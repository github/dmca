**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the copyright holder of this project. This project is Unlicensed, which makes it "All rights reserved."

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The project is located at [private]  
There are very clear commits which were committed way before the offending repository existed.  
The offender has downloaded the project, changed the details to link to their [private] and claimed the project as theirs.

The repository holder has been contacted through an issue which they acknowledged previously. They had made the repository private but I had later discovered that they had made the repository public again.

The offender was warned through this issue, but later failed to keep side of the agreement: https://github.com/Mr-Proxy-source/nitro-sniper/issues/2

They were again contacted on [private] once I had discovered them infringing copyright again: [private]  
The offender denied the request to delete the repository or private it, hence the DMCA request.

There are no forks.
