GitHub has reversed the takedown notice previously processed and published at:

https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2022/11/2022-11-15-cobaltstrike.md

Based on additional review, GitHub has determined that the notice does not meet the requirements of our [DMCA Takedown Policy](https://docs.github.com/github/site-policy/dmca-takedown-policy) because of the issues raised by the previous retraction:
https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2022/11/2022-11-17-cobaltstrike-retraction.md

Accordingly, GitHub has decided to reject this notice and restore any content previously disabled due to this notice. Please note, should the complainant provide additional information, we will review it against our DMCA Takedown Policy to determine if additional action is necessary.
If you have been affected by this takedown notice and have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.
