This repository exists to provide transparency by posting the text of DMCA notices and counter notices received.

If you are looking to file or dispute a takedown notice by posting to this repository, please STOP :stop_sign: because we do not accept Pull Requests or other contributions to this repository. 

But read on to learn about the available paths forward.


If you are a copyright owner wishing to submit a takedown notice, read our [DMCA Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/dmca-takedown-policy) and [Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice). You can submit the actual notice using our special [Copyright Claims Contact Form](https://github.com/contact/dmca).

If you are the owner of a repository that has been taken down, you have two main options:

  - Do you want to [make changes](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/dmca-takedown-policy#c-what-if-i-inadvertently-missed-the-window-to-make-changes) to the repository that would remove the allegedly infringing content? If that is possible in your case, [contact us](https://support.github.com/contact) to let us know that you would like to make the changes.

  - Do you want to formally dispute the action by [submitting a counter notice](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice)? Maybe the person sending the takedown notice does not hold the copyright or did not realize that you have a license or made some other mistake in their takedown notice. If you believe your content on GitHub was mistakenly disabled by a DMCA takedown request, you have the right to contest the takedown by [submitting a counter notice](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice). If you do, we will wait 10-14 days and then re-enable your content unless the copyright owner initiates a legal action before then.

If you do not want to make changes or dispute the notice, but still have general concerns about the copyright laws and how they apply in your case, know that GitHub and developers have the opportunity and a voice to advocate for changes in law and public policy to better support software development. We are constantly looking to [advocate for developers](https://github.blog/category/company/policy/), so feel free to [reach out](https://support.github.com/contact) and let us know your concerns. We also encourage you to [learn more about copyright and speak up](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/dmca-takedown-policy#learn-more-and-speak-up) by reaching out to the Copyright Office or your local lawmakers to voice your concerns.

If you would just like to comment on a commit to discuss it, that's fine, but again please note that GitHub does not actively monitor comments or other contributions to this repository. So if you want send a comment *to GitHub* for any reason about this repository, please [contact us directly](https://support.github.com/contact). Thanks!
