Mazda has invested tremendous time and resources to develop confidential and proprietary information including computer code used by company. Recently certain Mazda Information, including proprietary API information, was used to create code and information posted to GitHub.com identified in repository of bdr99 ([private]). This repository contains code developed in python (https://github.com/bdr99/pymazda) and javascript (https://github.com/bdr99/node-mymazda), and appears to have been uploaded and used to create computer code associated with home-assistant.io and mobile applications.  MNAO analyzed some of the code and determined that the code provides functionality same as what is currently in Apple App Store and Google Play App Store.  We are requesting immediate removal of code from Github, brd99.  Our understanding is that this code has been made available to home-assistant.io and perhaps others so further investigation on these entities are underway.  MNAO is attempting to reach out to [private] but at present have not received response.
