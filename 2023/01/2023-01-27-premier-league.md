Dear Sir/Madam,

The Football Association Premier League Limited (the "Premier League") is the organising body of the top-level competition for football clubs in England and Wales.

The Premier League controls the worldwide audio-visual rights to each Premier League match played as part of the Premier League football competition and is responsible for the licensing of the audio-visual rights to all Matches in territories around the world.

We are aware that a GitHub Page (the “Page”) is promoting access to and offering unauthorised audio-visual Premier League content. Please see the specific URL as follows:

https://tvbolaonline98.github.io/live/eng.html

This Page is promoting access to and offering unauthorised audio-visual Premier League content. Please see an example video attached.

As the owner has neither sought nor obtained permission from the Premier League or any of its authorised licensees to offer audio-visual Premier League content, their actions amount to an infringement of the Premier League’s rights.

The Premier League considers its intellectual property rights to be extremely valuable and has a duty to its stakeholders and licensees to protect such intellectual property. The Premier League has taken extensive legal action in a number of jurisdictions to protect its rights and will continue to do so wherever its rights are infringed.

We therefore request you take immediate action to remove this infringing Page.

Please confirm to us via email to that you have done so.

I have a good-faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

I, [private], under penalty of perjury, state that the above information is accurate and that the Premier League is the copyright owner.

I have taken fair use into consideration.

All of the Premier League’s rights and remedies are expressly reserved. 

Yours faithfully,

[private]
