**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the copyright owner of the code and project being infringed upon. As the [private] and the [private] of the project, I hold the exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute, and publicly display the copyrighted material. I have not authorized the infringing party to use, reproduce, or distribute my code in any form.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original work in question is a software project titled "Harbour". This project does not have an explicit open source license; however, it is protected by copyright law. As the [private] and the [private] of the project, I hold the exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute, and publicly display the copyrighted material.

The software project "Harbour" is a Node.js REST API for a video game's multiplayer. It contains original code, algorithms, design patterns, and custom implementations that are the result of creative expression and effort. Without an open source license, the default copyright protection applies, which means that the unauthorized use, copying, distribution, or modification of the code is prohibited.

The project was originally hosted on a private repository with the URL: [private]

Previously, a team member who had legitimate access to the codebase, specifically @devvjs, downloaded the source code. However, after their removal from the team, they have leaked the code, leading to the infringement of my exclusive rights as the copyright owner.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository located at the following URL should be taken down:  
Repository URL: https://github.com/devvjs/harbour

The repository contains the unauthorized publication of the original copyrighted work "Harbour". Due to the leak and infringement, I request the complete removal of the repository from GitHub.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I have conducted a thorough search for forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories, and I have not identified any forks associated with the infringing content. Therefore, there are no additional forks to be taken down apart from the original repository mentioned in the previous sections.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I have obtained the alleged infringer's contact information:

Name: [private]

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
