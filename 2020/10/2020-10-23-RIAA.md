Dear 👸 Sir 👨 or Madam 🍹:

I 👁 am contacting 📞 you 👈🏼 on 🔛 behalf 😬 of the Recording 📝 Industry 💦🏭✋ Association 🖕 of America 🇺🇸, Inc ✂⁉⚠. (RIAA) and
its member 🍆 record 📹 companies 🏢🏤. The RIAA is a trade 💵 association 🤝 whose 🌄 member 🍇 companies 🏢
create 💯, manufacture 👺 or distribute 📫 sound 🔊 recordings 🎥 representing 🙅 approximately ⭕ eighty-five (85 ⬅)
percent 🔟 of all 💯🌟 legitimate 🎗🍬 recorded 😭😤😡 music 🎧 consumption 😋 in the United 🇺🇸 States 🇺🇸. Under 😀 penalty ☠ of
perjury, we submit 😯 that the RIAA is authorized ✅ to act 🎭 on 🔛 behalf 😬 of its member 🍆💦 companies 🏢👁 on 🔛
matters 🙅 involving 👐🔟 the infringement ‼ of their sound 👂 recordings 📝, audiovisual works 🏢 and images 🖼,
including 📲 enforcing ☁ their copyrights and common 🐩 law 😾👮🏻❌ rights ✔ on 🔛 the Internet 🌐.

Copyright Violations 👿👎. We have learned 😌 that your 👉 service 🛎 is hosting 🏠 the youtube-dl source 👍👌💯 code 🚱
on 🔛 its network 🌐 at the following 👣 locations 🗺, among ☪ others 👪:

The above 🆙 list 📝 includes 📲 a representative 🅱 sample 🥄🍴 of the youtube-dl forks 🍴 of the youtube-dl
source 📰 code 💻 being hosted 🎩 on 🔛 GitHub. Based 👌 on 🔛 our review 📜 of the representative 🅱 sample 🎤 noted ❗
above 🔝, we have a good 👌 faith 🚫⛪ belief 🙏 that most of the youtube-dl forks 🍴 are infringing 💢 to the same
extent 👆 as the parent 👫 repository.

The clear 🔎 purpose 😈 of this source 📰 code 🚱 is to (i 👁) circumvent 🥺 the technological 📱 protection 🛡 measures 📐🥉🥈
used 🎶 by authorized ✅ streaming 😭 services 🛎 such as YouTube 👨🏾‍💻, and (ii 😂💦😠) reproduce 🌼💦 and distribute 📫 music 🎶🥵🤬
videos 📼 and sound 🔊 recordings 🎥 owned 😎 by our member 🍆 companies 🏢 without 🚫 authorization for such
use 🏻. We note 📝 that the source 📰 code 💻 is described 🗣💬🤔 on 🔛 GitHub as “a command-line program 📺 to
download 📲 videos 📼 from YouTube.com and a few more sites.”1

We also 👨 note 📝 that the source 📰🎨
code 🚱 prominently 💪 includes 📲 as sample 🎤 uses ✍🏻 of the source 📰🎨 code 🚱 the downloading 🖕 of copies 📝 of our
members’ copyrighted 🙃 sound 👂 recordings 🎥 and music 🥵🎵👨‍🎤 videos 📼, as noted ❗ in Exhibit 🅰 A hereto. For
example 💪, as shown 👀 on 💦 Exhibit 🤐 A, the source 📰 code 💻 expressly 😤 suggests 🤭 its use 🏻 to copy 📝😡 and/or 🤖
distribute 🔂🆕📱 the following 👣 copyrighted 🙃 works 🏢 owned 😎 by our member 🍆💦 companies 🏢:

• Icona Pop 💥 – I 👁 Love 😍 It (feat 💥. Charli 😌 XCX) [Official 🗽 Video 📹], owned 😎 by Warner ‼⚠ Music 🎶🤘 Group 👥💝
• Justin 🇨🇦 Timberlake – Tunnel 🎧 Vision 👁 (Explicit), owned 😎 by Sony 💝 Music 🎶 Group 👨‍👩‍👧‍👧
• Taylor 👧🏼 Swift 🏃💨 – Shake 🤝 it Off 📴, owned/exclusively licensed by Universal 😱🌌🙌 Music 🎶🤗 Group 👥🚹

The source 📰 code 💻 notes 📝 that the Icona Pop 💥 work 💼 identified above 🔝 is under 😀 the YouTube 📹 Standard 🚹
license 💳🚘, which expressly 🚛 restricts 🚫❌👉 access 🔖🔑 to copyrighted 🙃 works 🏢 only for streaming 😭 on 🔛↗📲 YouTube 📺
and prohibits 👮 their further 😵 reproduction 🌼💦 or distribution 😈 without ❌ consent ✅ of the copyright owner 💯;
that the Justin 👦 Timberlake work 💼 identified above 🔝 is under ⬇ an additional ➕ age 📆 protection 🛡
identifier; and that the request ❓ for the Taylor 👸 Swift 🏃🏻🙏 work 🏢 identified above ⬆🅰 is to obtain 👌, without ❌😪
authorization of the copyright owner 💯 or YouTube 📺, an M4A audio file 📂 from the audiovisual work 🏢
in question ❔⁉❓.

We have a good 👌🏼 faith 🚫⛪ belief 🌈 that this activity 🏃🏻 is not authorized ✅ by the copyright owner 💯, its agent 🕵,
or the law ⚖📝. We assert 👊 that the information ℹ🎤🔁 in this notification 👀👌 is accurate ☑, based 🔥👌😫 upon 👦 the data 📉
available 😎 to us 🇺🇸.

Anticircumvention Violation 🚫. We also ➕ note 📓 that the provision 💰 or trafficking of the source 📰 code 🚱
violates 👿 17 🥖🥛➖ USC §§1201(a)(2) and 1201(b)(1). The source 📰 code 🚱 is a technology 💡 primarily 💦
designed 😋 or produced 👺 for the purpose 😈 of, and marketed for, circumventing a technological 💡
measure 🔥 that effectively 💀 controls 🎛 access 🔖 to copyrighted 🙃 sound 👂 recordings 📝 on 🔛 YouTube 📹, including 💨
copyrighted 🙃 sound 👂🏻 recordings 🎥 owned 😎 by our members 🍆. For further 😵 context 🔎, please 🙏 see 👀 the
attached 🎗 court 🏛 decision 🤔👍 from the Hamburg Regional 🇯🇵🇰🇷🇩🇪 Court 💼 that describes 👇🙌 the technological 💡
measure 📐 at issue ⚠ (known 🎓✔ as YouTube’s “rolling cipher”), and the court’s determination 💪🏻 that the
technology 📱 employed 👨🏻‍💼👌 by YouTube 📺 is an effective 💀 technical 🥋🤹 measure 🔥 within 🅰 the meaning 😏 of EU 😍

1 ❗
See 👀 https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md#readme.

and German 🚨 law 👮, which is materially 😡 identical 👙💦👌 to Title 😏 17 🥖🥛➖ U.S.C. §1201 of the United 🇺🇸 States 📔
Code 💻. The court 💼 further 🔙🤔 determined 😤😠 that the service 📣 at issue ⚠ in that case 📋 unlawfully
circumvented YouTube’s rolling 🙄 cipher 🙊🙈 technical 🥋🤹 protection 🛡 measure.2
The youtube-dl source 📰 code 🚱 functions 👨 in a manner 🤬 essentially 💯‼ identical 👙💦👌 to the service 🛎 at issue 😼👌💥 in
the Hamburg Regional 🇯🇵🇰🇷🇩🇪 Court 💼 decision 🤔. As there, the youtube-dl source 📰 code 💻 available 😎 on 🔛
Github (which is the subject 🔥💥❄ of this notice 👀) circumvents 🥺 YouTube’s rolling 🙄 cipher 🙊🙈 to gain 💪
unauthorized 🤐 access 🔖🔑 to copyrighted 🙃 audio files 📂, in violation 🚫 of YouTube’s express 😀 terms 📄 of
service,3 and in plain 😁 violation 👿 of Section 📦 1201 of the Digital 🚫 Millennium 💯 Copyright Act 🎬🎭, 17 📅 U.S.C.
§1201.

Indeed 👌, the comments 💬 in the youtube-dl source 👍👌💯 code 🚱 make 💘 clear 🔎 that the source 📰🎨 code 💻 was
designed 😋 and is marketed for the purpose 😈 of circumventing YouTube’s technological 💡 measures 🎛
to enable 😺 unauthorized 🤐 access 🔖 to our member’s copyrighted 🙃 works 💼, and to make 💘 unauthorized 🤐
copies 📝✒ and distributions 💸 thereof 🙈: they identify 👙💦👌 our member’s works 💼, they note 📝 that the works 💼
are VEVO videos 📼 (virtually 📲 all 💯 of which are owned 😎💯 by our member 🍆 companies 🏢), they
acknowledge ⬜🔩 the those works 🏢 are licensed to YouTube 👨🏾‍💻 under 😀 the YouTube 🔫📺 standard 🕴 license 💳, and
they use 🏻 those examples 💪 in the source 📰 code 🚱 to describe 👇🙌 how to obtain ✋🛃 unauthorized 🤐 access 🔖🔑 to
copies 👌 of our members’ works 🏢.

In light 💡 of the above 🆙 noted ❗ copyright infringements 😢 and anticircumvention violations 👿, we ask 🙏
that you 👈 immediately 👇 take 💅 down ⬇ and disable ♿ access 🔖 to the youtube-dl source 📰 code 🚱 at all 💯 of its
locations 🗺 where it is hosted 🎩 on 🔛 GitHub, including ✔ without 🚫🙅 limitation 💃 those locations 🤓🗺 in the
representative 🇺🇸 list 📇 set 📐 forth 🔛 above 🔝.

This e-mail 💻 does not constitute 📜 a waiver of any right ✔ to recover 😘 damages 💥 incurred by virtue 😏 of
any such unauthorized 🤐 activities 🏃🏻, and all 💯😫 such rights ✔ as well 😦 as claims 🎸 for other relief 😅 are
expressly 🚛 reserved 4️⃣.

You 👈 may 🗓 contact 📞 me at RIAA, [private 🕵🏻‍♂️] Tel 😘. [private 🕵],
or email 💻 [private 🕵] to discuss 🗣👄 this notice 😯.

Sincerely 🖕,
