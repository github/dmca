Dear 👸 Sir 👨 or Madam 🍹:   
  
I 👁 am contacting 📞 you 👈🏼 on 🔛🐑♈ behalf 😬 of the Recording 🎥 Industry 🏭 Association 🖕 of America 🎇🎊🇺🇸, Inc ✂⁉⚠. (RIAA) and

percent 💡 of all 💯 legitimate 😫 recorded 📷📸🎥 music 🎵 consumption 😋 in the United 🇺🇸 States 🇺🇸. Under 😡 penalty 😤😠😈 of   
perjury, we submit ❗ that the RIAA is authorized 👑 to act 🎭 on 🔛 behalf 😬 of its member 🍇 companies 🏢 on 🔛   
matters 🙅 involving 😮 the infringement 😢 of their sound 👂 recordings 🎥, audiovisual works 🏢 and images 📸,   
including 📵 enforcing ☁ their copyrights and common 😍🐩 law 👮⚖ rights ✔ on 🔛 the Internet 🌐.   
  
Copyright Violations 👿. We have learned 1️⃣ that your 👉🍆💦 service 🙅 is hosting 🏠 the youtube-dl source 📰 code 🚱

The above 🔝 list 📝 includes 📲 a representative 🇺🇸 sample 💦‼📦 of the youtube-dl forks 🍴 of the youtube-dl   
source 📰🎨 code 🚱 being hosted 🎩 on 🔛 GitHub. Based 👌💯💦 on 🔛 our review 📜 of the representative 🅱 sample 🌋🏊 noted ❗   
above ⬆👆, we have a good 👀👍 faith 🕊 belief 🙏 that most of the youtube-dl forks 🍴 are infringing 💢 to the same   
extent 👀 as the parent 👪 repository.   
  
The clear 😋😉 purpose 😄 of this source 👍👌💯 code 💻 is to (i 👁) circumvent 🥺 the technological 📱 protection 🛡 measures 📏📐   
used 🎶 by authorized 👑 streaming 😭 services 📣 such as YouTube 📺, and (ii 💣🔫) reproduce 🌼💦 and distribute 🔂🆕📱 music 🔊🎵🎶   
videos 📼 and sound 👂 recordings 🎥 owned 🇺🇸😂 by our member 🍇 companies 💼 without ❌😖 authorization for such   
use 📤🏻. We note 📓 that the source 📰 code 🚱 is described 🗣💬🤔 on 🔛 GitHub as “a command-line program 📺 to   
download 💻📲 videos 📹 from YouTube.com and a few more sites.”1   
  
We also 👨 note 📝 that the source 📰   
code 🚱 prominently 💪 includes 💨 as sample 🔬 uses 🏻 of the source 📰 code 🚱 the downloading 🖕 of copies 📝 of our   
members’ copyrighted 🙃 sound 🔊🔈 recordings 📝 and music 🎶 videos 📹, as noted ❗ in Exhibit 🏛 A hereto. For   
example 💪, as shown 💯 on 🔛 Exhibit 🤐 A, the source 👍👌💯 code 💻 expressly 🚛 suggests 🤭 its use 😏 to copy 📝✒ and/or 🤔🧐🤨   
distribute 🔂🆕📱 the following 👣 copyrighted 🙃 works 💼 owned 😎😈😤 by our member 🍆 companies 💼:   
  
• Icona Pop 💥 – I 👁 Love ❤ It (feat 👣. Charli 🥰💞🌱 XCX) [Official 🗽 Video 📼], owned 😎 by Warner ‼ Music 🔊🎵🎶 Group 👥   
• Justin 👦 Timberlake – Tunnel 🚇 Vision 👀 (Explicit), owned 😎 by Sony 🍚 Music 🎵🎶 Group 👥   
• Taylor 👖👕🧵 Swift 🏃💨 – Shake 🤝 it Off 📴, owned/exclusively licensed by Universal 😱 Music 💿🎧🎵 Group 👥   
  
The source 📰 code 💻 notes 📝 that the Icona Pop 💥 work 🏢 identified above 🔝 is under 😡 the YouTube 👨🏾‍💻 Standard 🕴   
license 💳, which expressly 🚛 restricts ❌🔐 access 🔖🔑 to copyrighted 🙃 works 🏢 only for streaming 😭 on 🔛 YouTube 📹   
and prohibits 🚫 their further 🔙🤔 reproduction 💦💯 or distribution 😈 without ❌😖 consent ✅ of the copyright owner 💯;   
that the Justin 🇨🇦 Timberlake work 💼 identified above ⬆ is under ⬇ an additional ➕ age 📆 protection 🛡⚔   
identifier; and that the request 🙏🏼🙌🏼 for the Taylor 👧🏼 Swift 🏃 work 🏢 identified above 🔝 is to obtain ✋🛃, without ❌😖   
authorization of the copyright owner 🌊🚙😎 or YouTube 📹, an M4A audio file 📂 from the audiovisual work 🏢   
in question ❓.   
  
We have a good 👍 faith 🚫⛪ belief 🌈 that this activity 🏃🏻 is not authorized ✅ by the copyright owner 💯, its agent 🕵️‍♂️,   
or the law 👮. We assert 👩‍⚖️ that the information ℹ in this notification 👀 is accurate ☑, based ❌👨‍❤️‍👨 upon 👦 the data 📉   
available 💢 to us 👨.   
  
Anticircumvention Violation 🚫. We also ➕ note 📝 that the provision 💰 or trafficking of the source 📰 code 💻   
violates 🚫 17 🥖🥛➖ USC §§1201(a)(2) and 1201(b)(1). The source 👍👌💯 code 💻 is a technology 📱💻 primarily ‼😩💦   
designed 😋 or produced 📡 for the purpose 😈 of, and marketed for, circumventing a technological 💡   
measure 🎛 that effectively 💀 controls 🎮 access ♿ to copyrighted 🙃 sound 🔊 recordings 📝 on 🔛 YouTube 📹, including 📩   
copyrighted 🙃 sound 🔊 recordings 🎥 owned 😎 by our members 🍆. For further 🤔😝 context 🤗, please 🙏🏽🤤🍌 see 👀 the   
attached ⛓🤠 court 💼 decision 👯 from the Hamburg Regional 🇯🇵🇰🇷🇩🇪 Court 🏛 that describes 👇🙌 the technological 💡   
measure 🎛 at issue ⚠ (known 🎓 as YouTube’s “rolling cipher”), and the court’s determination 💪🏻 that the   
technology 💡 employed 👨🏻‍💼👌 by YouTube 📹 is an effective 💀 technical 🔧❌ measure 📐 within 👌🅰 the meaning 😏 of EU ▶   
  
1 ❗   
See 😂👀👌 https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md#readme.   
  
and German 🇩🇪 law 👮, which is materially 😡 identical 🆔 to Title 😏 17 🕚 U.S.C. §1201 of the United 🇺🇸 States 🇺🇸   
Code 🚱. The court 💼 further 🤔😝 determined 😤 that the service 🛎 at issue ⚠ in that case 📋 unlawfully   
circumvented YouTube’s rolling 🙄 cipher 🙊🙈 technical 🔧❌ protection 🛡 measure.2   
The youtube-dl source 📰 code 🚱 functions 👨 in a manner 🤬 essentially 💯🔆 identical 👙💦👌 to the service 🛎 at issue ⚠ in   
the Hamburg Regional 🇯🇵🇰🇷🇩🇪 Court 🏛 decision 👯. As there, the youtube-dl source 📰 code 💻 available 😎 on 🔛   
Github (which is the subject 📓📔 of this notice 👀) circumvents 🥺 YouTube’s rolling 🙄📴 cipher 🙊🙈 to gain 🌎🐖🏋   
unauthorized 🤐 access 🔖 to copyrighted 🙃 audio files 📂, in violation 👿👎 of YouTube’s express 😤 terms 📄 of   
service,3 and in plain 😶😐 violation 🚫 of Section 😼👌💥 1201 of the Digital 🔢 Millennium 💯 Copyright Act 🎭, 17 🥖🥛➖ U.S.C.   
§1201.   
  
Indeed ✔, the comments 📄📬📨 in the youtube-dl source 👍👌💯 code 💻 make 🖕 clear 😋😉 that the source 📰🎨 code 🚱 was   
designed 😋 and is marketed for the purpose 😄 of circumventing YouTube’s technological 📱💻 measures 📐🥉🥈   
to enable 😺 unauthorized 🤐 access 🔖 to our member’s copyrighted 🙃 works 🏢, and to make 💘 unauthorized 🤐   
copies 👌 and distributions 🛰🚤🚙 thereof 🙈: they identify 🆔 our member’s works 💼, they note 📝 that the works 💼   
are VEVO videos 📼 (virtually 🔥 all 💯 of which are owned 😎 by our member 🍆 companies 🏢), they   
acknowledge 🔎 the those works 🏢 are licensed to YouTube 📺 under ⬇ the YouTube 📺 standard 🕴 license ©🍽, and   
they use 🙏🏻 those examples 💪 in the source 📰 code 🚱 to describe 👇🙌 how to obtain 😂 unauthorized 🤐 access 🔖🔑 to   
copies 👌 of our members’ works 💼.   
  
In light 💡 of the above 🔝 noted ❗ copyright infringements ‼ and anticircumvention violations 🚫❌, we ask 🙏   
that you 👈🎮 immediately 😤 take 💅💎 down ⬇ and disable ♿ access ♿ to the youtube-dl source 📰 code 💻 at all 💯 of its   
locations 🍆 where it is hosted 🎩 on 🔛 GitHub, including ✔ without ❌😖 limitation ⌛ those locations 🗺📍 in the   
representative 🅱 list 📇 set 📐 forth 🔛 above ⤴🔝.   
  
This e-mail 💻 does not constitute 📃 a waiver of any right 👌 to recover 🚑 damages 💥 incurred by virtue 😇 of   
any such unauthorized 🤐 activities 🏃🏻, and all 💯 such rights 👌 as well 😦 as claims 🎸 for other relief 😖 are   
expressly 🚛 reserved 🙅🏼‍♀️😤.   
  
You 👈 may 🗓 contact 📞 me at RIAA, [private 😜😩] Tel 😘. [private 😜😩],   
or email 📧💦 [private 🕵🏻‍♂️] to discuss 🗣👄 this notice 😯.
