Dear Sir or Madam:

I am contacting you on behalf of the Recording Industry Association of America, Inc. (a bunch of cunts who abuse monopolies). To put it simply we have a monopoly and we take down anyone we dont like.

Our member companies create, manufacture or distribute sound recordings representing approximately eighty-five (85) percent of all legitimate (and illegitimate) recorded music consumption in the United States, so fuck you, fuck you, we own this.

Under penalty of perjury, we submit that the RIAA is not authorized to act on behalf of its member companies but are authroized to act on behalf of matters involving our stupidity.

We, as an organization are full of dumbfucks.

The clear purpose of this source code is to (i) download porn and (ii) download porn
You may contact me at RIAA, ronald@riaa.sucks, Tel. 420-690-420,
or email dickheads@riaa.sucks to discuss how fucking dumb we are.

Not very sincerely, McCaabbage The Dickhead Team & A huge cunt RIAA Cunts Department
