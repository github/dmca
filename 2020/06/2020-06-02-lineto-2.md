**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**   
   
Yes, I am the copyright holder.   
   
**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**   
   
Yes, I am the copyright holder.   
   
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**   
   
Yes, we Lineto GmbH are the copyright owner of the font LL Circular   
   
https://github.com/yosseld/circular-std/tree/master/fonts  
https://github.com/yosseld/circular-std/blob/master/README.md  
   
**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**   
   
We are a Swiss Typefoundry and the owner and sole distributer of LL Circular (https://lineto.com/typefaces/circular?tab=about). The Font is available as a free download on Github: https://github.com/yosseld/circular-std
It incorrectly (!) states that the font is available under Open Font License (MIT) in the ReadMe file (Contains direct reference to LL Circular), which has already caused a legal case with a third party.   
   
**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**
