**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am [private] for Lynx Collective which are the owners of ChocoHax Anticheat.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Our anticheat (ChocoHax) is the biggest anticheat on a framework known as FiveM. ChocoHax is not an open sourced project and it is sold encrypted to hundreds of FiveM server owners.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

We would like all of the files removed, as you can also see from the title of the repository this is a cracked version of our anticheat and we would like it removed before it starts to effect our revenue. From looking at “MasterLua's” other repositories I can see he has also uploaded / leaked other cracked content.

Here is the link to the repository: https://github.com/MasterLua/chocohax-cracked

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, luckily no forks have been made yet.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

ChocoHax is not an open sourced project.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

We would like it removed.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

The only contact information we know of is his [private] account as mentioned in his repository.
