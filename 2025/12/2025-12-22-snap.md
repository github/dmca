Re: DMCA Notice  
  
   
  
Dear GitHub DMCA Agent,  
  
   
  
Our firm represents Snap Inc. (“Snap”) in intellectual property matters. Snap is the owner of the copyright in the Snapchat software, application programming interface (“API”) and technology. See, e.g., https://www.snapchat.com/; https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.snapchat.android.  
  
   
  
Please consider this formal service of a Digital Millennium Copyright Act takedown notice. I have read and understand GitHub’s Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.  
  
   
  
It has come to our attention that the reported URLs create and distribute patched .apk files that copy Snap’s copyrighted works, namely the Snapchat code.  
  
   
  
Upon information and belief, the reported URLs each offer a tool for creating an LSPatch version of Snapchat. Specifically, the tool wraps LSPatch using GitHub actions which allow automation to trigger when a file in the repository is updated, and then automatically downloads a Snapchat .apk file upon which LSPatch is run to create a file with an unauthorized copy of the Snapchat code reproduced within it.
