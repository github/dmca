While GitHub did not find sufficient information to determine a valid anti-circumvention claim, we determined that this takedown notice contains other valid copyright claim(s).

---

Note: Because the parent repository was actively being forked when this DMCA takedown notice was received, and the submitter had identified all known forks at the time they submitted the takedown notice, GitHub processed the takedown notice against the entire network of 65 repositories, inclusive of the parent repository.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
I am the [private] [private] and copyright owner of the software application titled “Crypto Casino Platform”.  
[private] developed the application and hold full rights to its source code, design, and associated assets.  
The product is sold exclusively through [private] verified CodeCanyon author account.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**  
  
The copyrighted work is a web-based casino platform developed by me and titled “Crypto Casino Platform”.  
It includes all related source code, PHP scripts, front-end templates, assets, and documentation.  
  
The infringing GitHub repository reproduces or distributes this same software without authorization, including identical source code, file structure, and changelog text that matches [private] original version (version 1.15.2).  
  
The original product has been publicly available for purchase since its release on CodeCanyon (January 12, 2019) and is promoted through my official website.  
  
**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**  
  
**Based on the above, I confirm that:**  
  
The entire repository is infringing  
  
**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**  
  
https://github.com/Huniko519/Crypto-Casino-Platform  
  
**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**  
  
Yes  
  
**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**  
  
The copyrighted software is distributed only through authorized channels (Envato / CodeCanyon), where access requires a valid purchase. The downloadable package is not publicly available, and its use is governed by CodeCanyon’s licensing system. Unauthorized redistribution circumvents these access controls.  
  
**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**  
  
The accused project publicly hosts and distributes the complete application source code and installable package, which directly circumvents access controls and commercial distribution model. My software is distributed only to paying customers via CodeCanyon; access to downloads requires a valid purchase and is governed by license checks. By publishing the full source and package on GitHub the repository:  
  
- Makes the software downloadable and executable without a valid purchase or license;  
- Removes or bypasses any license/purchase-code checks or distribution restrictions that would normally prevent unauthorized use;  
- Reproduces the same file structure, assets, and changelog entries found in our official releases (verifiable via our product page and changelog), which indicates the protected distribution package was copied directly; and  
- Enables anyone to install and run the product (or repackage and redistribute it) without interacting with our authorized sales channels, thereby defeating the technological and contractual protections that control access to the copyrighted work.  
  
**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**
