I am the [private] [private] and copyright holder of the SRM Exam Seat Finder project.  
[private] created this project from scratch and first published it on GitHub at

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**  
  
The entire repository is infringing

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**  
  
Yes  
  
**Which license?**  
  
other  
  
**How do you believe the license is being violated?**  
  
The infringing repository violates [private] CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license in multiple ways:  
  
1. UNAUTHORIZED RELICENSING:  
- Original license: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0  
- Infringing repository license: Apache 2.0  
- Violation: The NoDerivatives (ND) clause prohibits changing the license  
terms. The infringer has no right to relicense [private] work under Apache 2.0.  
  
2. CREATION OF DERIVATIVE WORKS:  
- The "ND" (NoDerivatives) clause explicitly prohibits remixing,  
transforming, or building upon [private] work  
- The infringer has made modifications, improvements, and changes to  
the original code  
- Any modification violates the NoDerivatives restriction  
  
3. REMOVAL OF LICENSE FILE:  
- [private] original LICENSE file containing CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 terms has been removed  
- The infringer replaced it with an Apache 2.0 license  
- This removes the legal notice that protects my copyright  
  
4. INADEQUATE ATTRIBUTION:  
- CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 requires proper attribution to the original creator  
- The repository does not clearly indicate it is based on [private] original work  
- No link to [private] original repository in prominent locations  
  
5. MISREPRESENTATION OF OWNERSHIP:  
- By changing the license and removing proper attribution, the infringer  
presents this as their own original project  
- This misleads users about the true origin and terms of the work  
  
Summary: The infringer may only use [private] work if they keep it completely  
unmodified, maintain the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license, and provide proper  
attribution. They have violated all of these terms.  
  
**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**  
  
To bring the project into compliance with [private] CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license, the  
infringer must do ALL of the following:  
  
1. RESTORE ORIGINAL LICENSE:  
- Remove the Apache 2.0 license file  
- Add back the original CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 LICENSE file  
- Ensure the license is clearly visible in the repository root  
  
2. REVERT ALL MODIFICATIONS:  
- Remove any and all changes, improvements, or modifications made to [private]  
original code  
- Restore the code to its exact original state from [private] repository  
- The NoDerivatives clause requires the work to remain completely unmodified  
  
3. PROVIDE PROPER ATTRIBUTION:  
- Add clear attribution to [private] as the original creator in README.md  
- Include a link to [private] original repository:  
[private]  
- Add a notice stating: "This project is based on work by [Your Name],  
licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0"  
  
4. ADD COPYRIGHT NOTICES:  
- Include copyright notices in source files where appropriate  
- Maintain all original copyright statements  
  
HOWEVER, I prefer complete removal of the repository because:  
- The NoDerivatives clause means they cannot make ANY modifications  
- If they want an unmodified copy, they should fork [private] repository properly  
- The license violations demonstrate bad faith use of [private] work  
  
Acceptable alternatives (in order of preference):  
1. Complete removal of the repository (PREFERRED)  
2. Full compliance with all 4 requirements above (only if completely unmodified)  
3. Contact me directly to negotiate a separate license agreement for derivative works
