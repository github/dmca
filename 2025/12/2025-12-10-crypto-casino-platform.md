**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The copyrighted software is distributed only through authorized channels (Envato / CodeCanyon), where access requires a valid purchase. The downloadable package is not publicly available, and its use is governed by CodeCanyon’s licensing system. Unauthorized redistribution circumvents these access controls.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project publicly hosts and distributes the complete application source code and installable package, which directly circumvents access controls and commercial distribution model. [private] software is distributed only to paying customers via CodeCanyon; access to downloads requires a valid purchase and is governed by license checks. By publishing the full source and package on GitHub the repository:

- Makes the software downloadable and executable without a valid purchase or license;  
- Removes or bypasses any license/purchase-code checks or distribution restrictions that would normally prevent unauthorized use;  
- Reproduces the same file structure, assets, and changelog entries found in our official releases (verifiable via our product page and changelog), which indicates the protected distribution package was copied directly; and  
- Enables anyone to install and run the product (or repackage and redistribute it) without interacting with our authorized sales channels, thereby defeating the technological and contractual protections that control access to the copyrighted work.
