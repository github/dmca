Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and copyright holder of this source code. I am the [private] of the GitHub account '[private]'. This repository hosts an unauthorized copy of [private] proprietary Salesforce source code. This content is identical to the infringing material that GitHub Trust & Safety recently disabled on Dec 4, 2025 (in my previous DMCA notice regarding user '[private]').

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The copyrighted work is [private] proprietary 'SalesforceOrgProject' source code. Although the user 'fotechv' has reset the git commit history to hide the original authorship (showing "fotechv first commit"), the file structure (folders: 'force-app/main/default', 'config', 'manifest', 'scripts') and the underlying code logic are 100% identical to the infringing content I previously reported. Since GitHub has already validated [private] ownership and removed the 'Sabrac' network, I request this re-uploaded copy be removed as well.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

The original repository was deleted by [private]. However, the validity of my claim was established in the recent DMCA takedown against the repository: [private] (which is now disabled by GitHub).

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/fotechv/SalesforceOrgProject

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
