We are intellectual property litigation counsel for Midwest Tape, LLC (“Midwest Tape”). Midwest Tape provides an online service and mobile software application called HOOPLA. See www.hoopladigital.com. Midwest Tape’s HOOPLA service provides patrons of public libraries with access to digital video, music, audiobooks, e-books, comics and other content via the HOOPLA web site and mobile application. Among other things, the HOOPLA service and application allows users to download the content for use on their mobile phone or tablet for a limited period of time. The digital content available through the HOOPLA service includes technological measures which limit the duration of the “library loan” of the copyrighted content. After the loan concludes, the digital content is removed and is no longer available on the user’s device.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

Midwest Tape recently became aware of numerous individuals operating under the GitHub user names “[private]”, “[private]” and “[private]”, among others, linking to software applications called “Hoopladownloader.zip” and “Hoopladownloaderng.zip” on the Github web site at:

https://github.com/jo1gi/audiobook-dl/issues/70#issuecomment-2568678048

“[private]” states “I am requesting to add Hoopla Digital to this script. Hoopla Digital is a web and mobile library media streaming platform launched in 2010 for audio books, comics, e-books, movies, music, and TV. Patrons of a library that supports Hoopla have access to its collection of digital media. Unlike Libby, Hoopla Digital is hold-free which means that there are no holds. You may know that Libby has long waiting queues of holds ranging even 2 months long. Hoopla doesn't have this problem, there are unlimited copies of each book. If you can somehow add Hoopla Digital to the extension it would be wonderful. If you don't have Hoopla let me know & I will share with you my credentials.”

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

Midwest Tape's Hoopla online service and mobile software application can be found at https://www.hoopladigital.com/.

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Midwest Tape’s HOOPLA digital platform is made available to libraries for use by their authorized cardholders. Users must register with the HOOPLA platform in order to access and use the platform, and Midwest Tape employs DRM security measures to limit users’ access to borrowed content. Hoopla content may be streamed via the HOOPLA digital website, www.hoopladigital.com, or streamed or temporarily downloaded via the HOOPLA digital app for tablets and mobile devices. Midwest Tape’s security measures include code that causes any downloaded content to be automatically removed from the user’s device upon the expiration of the borrow period. On every digital file that Midwest Tape offers through the HOOPLA service, it employs Digital Rights Management (DRM) protection via industry standard AES-128 encryption to prevent users from reading, watching, or listening to the files outside of the permitted use period.
All users are required to agree to Midwest Tape’s Terms and Conditions, which prohibit copyright infringement. Among other things, the Terms and Conditions include the following provisions to emphasize the limited access period and the prohibition on hacking the security features that protect the content on the platform:  
"All of the Content made available through the Platform is protected by intellectual property rights, including copyright, trademark, trade secret, and/or patent rights (collectively, “Intellectual Property Rights”) of Midwest Tape or its licensors or other third parties.  
If you are an authorized Library Patron, you may borrow and view the Content during the designated loan period for your own, personal, non-commercial use only (“Allowed Use”) and, during that limited loan period only . . . All Content is owned or licensed by Midwest Tape, LLC and/or third parties. In all circumstances, you understand and acknowledge that your rights with respect to Content will be limited by copyright law. You agree that you will not attempt to modify any apps, software, or Content accessed through the Platform for any reason whatsoever, including for the purpose of disguising or changing any indications of the ownership or source of the Content.  
You represent, warrant, and agree that you are using the Platform for your own personal, noncommercial, entertainment use and not for redistribution or transfer of any kind. You agree not to reproduce, modify, delete, disable, tamper with, redistribute, broadcast, publicly perform, or publicly display any Content, or otherwise transfer any Content accessed through the Platform.  
You agree that you will not, for any reason, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise tamper with any security components, software, usage rules, or other protection measures applicable to the Platform or Content."  
The "hoopladownloader.zip" and "hoopladownloaderng.zip" software linked to at https://github.com/jo1gi/audiobook-dl/issues/70#issuecomment-2571475981, and https://github.com/jo1gi/audiobook-dl/issues/70#issuecomment-2568678048 purport to set forth a method of circumventing these security measures and constitutes a breach of Midwest Tape’s Terms and Conditions for accessing and using the HOOPLA platform.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The "hoopladownloader.zip" and "hoopladownloaderng.zip" software linked to at https://github.com/jo1gi/audiobook-dl/issues/70#issuecomment-2571475981, and https://github.com/jo1gi/audiobook-dl/issues/70#issuecomment-2568678048 are intended to allow users to download audiobooks and videos from Hoopla Digital. In fact, it provides unauthorized tools to reverse engineer DRM encrypted and copyrighted content for unauthorized use outside our client’s platform for an unlimited time. The tools reverse engineers how decryption keys are acquired and uses those keys to strip DRM protection from copyrighted content. The code to circumvent our client's DRM can be found at lines 75 through 84 for https://github.com/jo1gi/audiobook-dl/issues/70#issuecomment-2571475981 and lines 74 through 83 for https://github.com/jo1gi/audiobook-dl/issues/70#issuecomment-2568678048 of the files currently named hoopla-key.py.  
The sole purpose of the “hoopladownloader.zip” and “hoopladownloaderng.zip” software is to circumvent the technological measures included with HOOPLA content which limit the user’s use of such content to the “library loan” period. As a result, the Hoopla-DL software violates, among other things, the anti-circumvention provisions of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(2)(A) (“No person shall manufacture, import, offer to the public, provide, or otherwise traffic in any technology, product, service, device, component, or part thereof, that is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title”).
