**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

World Beyond"《世界之外》 is a game legally authorized and operated by NetEase. NetEase holds complete intellectual property rights and the right to protect its rights for this game product.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The cracking tool package uploaded by users can crack the games that NetEase Company holds the intellectual property rights of, which leads to other users being able to reverse extract game resources such as plot files, static images, and audio from the wpk files in our mobile package after downloading the tool package. The infringement result is that the tool package cracks the normal program of the game, allowing other users to directly view normal program of the game, allowing other users to directly view the unreleased game resources without going through the normal gameplay, infringing on the rights and interests of normal players. Moreover, after cracking the game, users can use these game resources without authorization from NetEase Company, infringing on the intellectual property rights of NetEase Company.

关于github BW工具破解技术分析报告  
Analysis report on github BW tool cracking technology  
（一）破解工具技术类型分析  
（一）Analysis of tool technology types for cracking  
工具语言：C#、C++  
Tool languages: C#, C++  
依赖文件：*.idx  
Dependencies: *.idx  
解密文件：*.wpk    
Decrypted file: *.wpk  
所在包体位置：apk\assets\res\*.wpk  
Location of the package: apk\assets\res\*.wpk  

破解前，原始APK内的加密文件格式

（二）Before cracking: The encrypted file format of the original APK  
我们以加密的私有格式（wpk）提供《世界之外》游戏内的数据。不允许在游戏进程以外的环境直接看到游戏资源。只允许在游戏的过程中，通过游戏界面看到它们。We provide in-game data for 《 Beyond the World》 in an encrypted private format (wpk). Game resources are not allowed to be seen directly outside of the game process. They are only allowed to be seen through the game interface during the game process.

截图内为直接解压apk得到的内容。由此可见，apk内为加密后的文件格式，不允许用户直接看到《世界之外》游戏内的资源。The content in the screenshot is obtained by directly decompressing the apk. It can be seen that the files within the apk are in an encrypted format, preventing users from directly accessing the resources in the game 《 Beyond the World》.

关于破解《世界之外》游戏的证据（三）Evidence about cracking the game 《 Beyond the World》

下面是针对资源和程序代码的破解证据。证明该工具破解了我们的私有加密格式（wpk）。通过该工具，在我们的游戏进程之外，可以得到原始的资源图片和程序代码。这违背了允许范围内的使用方式。Below is the evidence of cracking resources and program code. This tool has cracked our proprietary encryption format (wpk). Through this tool, we can obtain the original resource images and program code outside of our game process. This violates the permitted usage scope.

具体证据Specific evidence

BW.Unpacker.exe是破解工具的可执行文件名称。  
BW.Unpacker.exe is the name of the executable file of the cracking tool.  
执行命令executive command  
BW.Unpacker.exe res\fonts.idx output\fonts

执行结果Execution results  
执行后，github平台的这个工具会把wpk文件中打包的资源文件，全部以文件原本md5值的命名的方式，将游戏的密文资源，全部解包。After execution, this tool on github platform will unpack the resource files packaged in the wpk file into plaintext resources, in the way of naming them according to their original md5 value.

如图，原本封装并加密的wpk文件内容被解包出来，得到了原始的文件，文件以md5命名。经过校验，这些文件与网易公司原始的有版权资产是完全相同的。As shown in the figure, the content of the wpk file which was originally encapsulated and encrypted is unpacked to get the original file, which is named in md5. After verification, these files are completely identical to the original copyrighted assets of NetEase Company.

文件分析file analysis  
这里我们随机挑选一个解包后的文件：3d71c7aa453e975bd0ca4b56e5f8cfb7，通过010 editor二进制文件查看，可以看到该文件为：png文件。Here we randomly select a unpacked file: 3d71c7aa453e975bd0ca4b56e5f8cfb7, through the 010 editor binary file view, you can see that the file is: png file

图片文件打开验证Image file opening verification  
将文件重命名，加上png的后缀，可直接打开为图片。Rename the file by adding the .png suffix, and it can be directly opened as an image.

程序代码破解证据Evidence of program code cracking

执行命令executive command  
BW.Unpacker.exe res\script.idx output\script

执行结果 Execution results   
执行后，大量程序代码被解包出来，同样，工具会把script.wpk文件所有的代码文件，全部以文件原本md5值的命名的方式，全部解包，这里选择第一个代码文件作为样例：`de9bc432a2b6b30ac29400bcfb7789c8` After execution, a large amount of program code is unpacked. Similarly, the tool will unpack all the code files in the script.wpk file with the original md5 value of the file name. Here, the first code file is selected as an example: `de9bc432a2b6b30ac29400bcfb7789c8`


文件分析file analysis  
这里对该样例文件添加.pyc的后缀，并通过010 editor二进制文件查看，运行pyc的模板，可以看到pyc文件结构可以被正常加载。Rename the sample file by adding the .pyc suffix, and then view it through the 010 editor binary file. By running the pyc template, you can see that the pyc file structure can be loaded normally.

脚本文件加载验证Script file loading verification  
使用python 2.7版本，使用marshal模块加载解密后的数据，可以看到，pyc已被成功加载到内存中。这直接证明了我们的代码，在游戏进程以外，被运行了。Using the python 2.7 version and the marshal module to load the decrypted data, you can see that pyc has been successfully loaded into memory. This directly proves that our code has been successfully executed outside the game process.
