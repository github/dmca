I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.

The DMCA takedown notice incorrectly asserts that the "entire repository is infringing." This repository acts as a collection of various, distinct educational tools, scripts, and projects related to school utilities. The vast majority of the code and files within this repository are unrelated to the specific "CanvasHack" extension mentioned in the complaint.

The complainant identified specific files related to "CanvasHack" but requested the disablement of the entire repository. Because the repository contains significant amounts of non-infringing, independent work that is not the subject of the copyright claim, the removal of the entire repository was an error in scope. The disabling of the non-infringing content constitutes a mistake and misidentification of the material to be removed.

I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located, and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.
