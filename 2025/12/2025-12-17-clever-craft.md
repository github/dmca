**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
I am the [private] for Clever Craft d.o.o.; Clever Craft is a [private] company, we specialize in custom web applications to support enterprise customers. Currently, we work with Hewlett Packard, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, F5 and NetApp. All our agreements and code built by us is in joint ownership with these entities.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**  
  
The repositories reported belong to an individual that was hired with a remote B2B contract to Clever Craft d.o.o.; He was in his probation period, undergoing training and received access to repositories for code we manage for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. We have an NDA B2B agreement with this individual, however, during his probation we found that both the passport documents he provided as well as a his company information was fraudulent. Ultimately, we have identified that "[private]" was actually part of the [private] remote worker scheme. The code in the repositories relates to the following Hewlett Packard Enterprise applications:  
- Compliance Management application code (internally referred to as ARK, a partner compliance management application)  
- New Order Request application code (internally referred to as NOR, an partner order submission form)  
- Enrollment (a program enrollment form)
