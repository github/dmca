**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**  
  
To Whom It may Concern:  
  
We hereby notify you on behalf of Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft Corporation”) that the following URLs (the “Infringing URLs”) which you are hosting contain content (the “Infringing Content”) that infringes the exclusive rights, copyright, and intellectual property of Microsoft Corporation.  
  
**1. Identification of the Copyrighted Work**  
  
The copyrighted work is the **MINECRAFT** game, including its proprietary code, visual assets, game functionality, and distribution rights, protected by copyright (the “MINECRAFT Copyright”) owned by Microsoft Corporation, available for reference at Microsoft Corporation’s official website: https://www.minecraft.net/.  
  
**2. Identification of the Infringing Material and Its Location**  
  
The specific locations of the Infringing Content are the following URLs:  
  
* `https://github.com/XNEOFF/MCPEUnlock/releases/tag/V1`  
* `https://github.com/OpenM-Project/modscraft_mcpe_apk/tree/main/version`  
  
**3. Detailed Explanation of Infringement**  
  
The repositories located at the Infringing URLs directly violate Microsoft’s copyright in the MINECRAFT game because they contain:  
  
* **Unauthorized Distribution:** The URL related to `modscraft_mcpe_apk` appears to host or distribute **unauthorized copies of the Minecraft Pocket Edition (MCPE) application file (APK)**. The distribution of the game client, in whole or in part, without a license from Microsoft is a direct and clear infringement of Microsoft's exclusive right to reproduce and distribute the MINECRAFT Copyright.  
* **Unauthorized Derivative Work/Circumvention:** The URL related to `MCPEUnlock` appears to host a program or file designed to unlawfully bypass technological measures or otherwise modify, unlock, or redistribute proprietary portions of the MINECRAFT game. This constitutes the creation and distribution of an **unauthorized derivative work** that utilizes and is based on Microsoft's proprietary code and copyrighted functionality.  
  
This unauthorized use, reproduction, and distribution damages the goodwill and reputation of Microsoft Corporation, causes consumer confusion, and causes immediate and irreparable harm to the value of the MINECRAFT Copyright.  
  
**4. Statement of Good Faith and Authority**  
  
We represent under penalty of perjury that the information in this notice is true and correct, and that we are authorized to act on behalf of Microsoft Corporation as the owner of the MINECRAFT Copyright. We have a good faith belief that the use of the Infringing Content in the URLs is not authorized by Microsoft Corporation as the owner of the MINECRAFT Copyright, its agents, or by law.  
  
**5. Request for Removal**  
  
Since you are hosting the Infringing URLs, we request that you immediately **disable or suspend access to all content at the above-listed URLs without delay.** We would appreciate your resolving this matter as soon as possible and confirming that you have done so within the next seven (7) days.  
  
Microsoft Corporation reserves the right to take whatever action it considers appropriate to protect its rights and nothing contained in this Notice is intended to constitute a waiver of any of Microsoft Corporation’s legal rights or remedies, all of which are hereby expressly reserved.  
  
Please let us know if you need any additional information.
