**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of Indx and am authorized to act on behalf of Indx / Bionic AS, the copyright owner. Indx is the sole owner of the copyrighted
proprietary software described below.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The copyrighted work is IndxSearchLib, a proprietary .NET search engine library developed and owned by Indx and distributed via NuGet under a
proprietary license.

IndxSearchLib contains original, non-public software code, internal abstractions, data structures, and algorithms, including but not limited to
internal lifecycle monitors, configuration systems, document models, indexing behavior, tokenization, segmentation, and relevance-processing
logic. These elements reflect protected structure, sequence, and organization that are not fully disclosed in public API documentation.

The license for IndxSearchLib explicitly prohibits reverse engineering, decompilation, derivation of source code, creation of derivative works, and
redistribution.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

https://www.nuget.org/packages/IndxSearchLib/

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

Specific files within the repository are infringing

**Identify only the specific file URLs within the repository that is infringing:**

https://github.com/lofcz/Infidex/blob/master/src/Infidex/Core/ConfigurationParameters.cs

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The copyrighted software is distributed exclusively as a compiled .NET NuGet package with source code withheld. The assemblies are protected
using commercial .NET obfuscation technology designed to prevent inspection, reverse engineering, and reconstruction of proprietary source code
and internal algorithms.

These measures effectively control access by ensuring the human-readable source code and algorithmic implementations are not accessible to end
users. The accompanying license explicitly prohibits decompilation, reverse engineering, or derivation of source code. The infringing repository
contains reconstructed source code that could only have been produced by circumventing these technological protection measures.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The original copyrighted software is distributed exclusively in compiled binary form via NuGet and is protected using Eziriz .NET Reactor (version
7.0). This protection applies multiple technological measures, including control-flow obfuscation, symbol renaming, string encryption, and anti-decompilation techniques, which are designed to prevent access to the original source code and internal implementation details.

The accused project circumvents these technological protection measures by reconstructing protected source-level implementation details from
the obfuscated binaries. This is evidenced by the presence of internal class structures, configuration schemes, execution flows, and non-public
design decisions that are not exposed through the public API, documentation, or any other lawful source.

Specifically, the accused project reproduces internal configuration identifiers, default parameter values, indexing and segmentation behaviors,
scoring and execution pipelines, and internal data models that were only present within the protected binaries. These elements could not be
derived from the public API alone and indicate deliberate de-obfuscation and reverse engineering of the protected assemblies.

The accused author has publicly stated their ability to decompile and reverse engineer .NET Reactor–protected assemblies, further supporting
that the project was created by circumventing the technological protection measures applied to the original software.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed
