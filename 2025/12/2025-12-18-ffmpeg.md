**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
I am a [private] to the FFmpeg project, the code from which is being infringed. More specifically, [private] have substantial contributions to the H.265 decoder in FFmpeg, the code from which (beside other decoders) is being infringed.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**  
  
FFmpeg is an LGPL-licensed multimedia processing toolkit containing multiple components. The component that is being infringed is the libavcodec library, which contains a large number of audio and video parsers and decoders for various formats.  
  
**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**  
  
https://ffmpeg.org/  
  
**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**  
  
**Based on the above, I confirm that:**  
  
Specific files within the repository are infringing  
  
**Identify only the specific file URLs within the repository that is infringing:**

Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**  
  
No  
  
**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**  
  
**Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.**  
  
**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**  
  
Yes  
  
**Which license?**  
  
gnu-lesser-general-public-license-v2.1  
  
**How do you believe the license is being violated?**  
  
The abovementioned files (and possibly others), are derived from libavcodec source code, as is clear from the code structure and identical comments. There are even some commented out calls to internal FFmpeg functions with the original names unchanged.  
Furthermore, developers of the offending repository themselves admitted taking the code from FFmpeg ([private]).  
  
The violation consists in the authors of https://github.com/rockchip-linux/mpp/  
- removing the original copyright notices and authorship information;  
- claiming to have authored the code in question;  
- distributing the code under the less restrictive Apache license.  
  
I believe all those violate the terms of LGPL.  
  
Furthermore, the offending repository maintainers were informed of the problem almost 2 years ago ([private]), and did nothing to resolve it. Worse, their last comment ([private]) suggests they do not intend to resolve it at all.  
  
**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**  
  
One possible change is to  
- remove false authorship claims;  
- restore original attribution and copyright notices;  
- distribute the code under an LGPL-compatible license (e.g. LGPL itself, GPL, AGPL, etc.).  
  
Another is to remove all infringing files.  
  
**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**  
  
**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**  
  
**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**  
  
**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
