If you are submitting this notice on behalf of a company, please be sure to use an email address on the company's domain. If you use a personal email address for a notice submitted on behalf of a company, we may not be able to process it.**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] [private] and copyright owner of the source code and content published in [private] GitHub repository. [private] wrote, developed, and uploaded this code [private], and I hold full rights to the material. I have not given permission to anyone, including the reported user, to copy, upload, or distribute [private] work.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work consists of a complete software project that [private] authored and published on [private] GitHub repository. This includes the source code files, folder structure, UI implementation, backend logic, styling files, assets, and the README documentation. All components of this project were created by [private]. The reported user has reproduced and uploaded the same project- including code, file structure, and documentation- on their GitHub account without [private] permission, thereby infringing on [private] copyright.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

https://github.com/Nandukumar-koribilli/Smart_Kisan

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The copyrighted material is controlled through GitHub's platform-level protections, including repository ownership, commit authorship verification, and permission settings. These measures ensure that only [private], as the owner, can modify or publish the original work. The infringing user bypassed these controls by copying and re-uploading [private] content to their own repository without authorization

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project circumvents my protection

measures by copying [private] source code and documentation from [private] original GitHub repository and re-uploading it into a separate repository without authorization. While GitHub allows public viewing, only the rightful owner can publish or manage the original content. By copying and presenting [private] work as their own, the accused user bypassed GitHub's built-in authorship verification and repository ownership mechanisms, which serve as the platform's technological protection measures.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

https://github.com/kattakoushik/Tecos_clone

**Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
