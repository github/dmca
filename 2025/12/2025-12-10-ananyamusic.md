Hello GitHub Support,

I previously submitted a DMCA takedown request for the repository:

Original infringing repository:  
[private]  
This repository has already been disabled.

Now I have identified several additional forks and copies of the same repository that also contain [private] copyrighted content without authorization.

Please disable/remove the following infringing repositories as well:

[private]  
[private]  
https://github.com/dragonworld70659-rgb/AnanyaMusic  
https://github.com/harshnu12035/AnanyaMusic  
[private]  
https://github.com/Itachu7890/AnanyaMusic  
https://github.com/nikhil390u8o/AnanyaMusic  
https://github.com/notxtest/AnanyaMusic  
[private]  
https://github.com/preyounew-glitch/AnanyaMusic

All of these repositories are forks, clones, or copies of [private] original project "AnanyaMusic", and they contain [private] copyrighted code without [private] permission.

I request that GitHub disable these repositories under the DMCA.

"I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice."  
"I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law."  
"I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed."  
"I have taken fair use into consideration."
