Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?

I don't understand how my dictionary infringes on Dreamtonics' property. I believe it's a mistake - my dictionary is just like any other fake XLS dictionaries. If it does infringe on their property, I want to to know what I need to change to keep distributing it.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.
