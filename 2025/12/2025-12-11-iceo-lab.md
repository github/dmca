As part of the remuneration for the performance of the agreement, [private] agreed to transfer to ICEO all proprietary copyrights (author’s economic rights) to the results of tasks performed by him. Based on aforementioned provision - the copyrights to the works (which were almost identical to the ones in the repository) belong to ICEO.  
  
I act as a [private] who's working in a law-firm which is a contractor of ICEO. We have a relevant power of attorney.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**  
  
The original copyrighted work is a proprietary Terraform codebase created exclusively for ICEO, a company operating within the [private] and the [private].  
  
This work was developed in its entirety by an employee in his capacity as a [private] engineer during the course of his employment at ICEO. Accordingly, all intellectual property rights to the code belong solely to ICEO.  
  
The codebase is structured as a monorepository containing a set of custom Terraform modules designed to provision and manage infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It implements industry best practices for security, resilience, and compliance in financial services, and was explicitly tailored to support regulatory obligations, including the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and related EU financial regulations.  
  
The original work includes the following modules and components:  
  
bastion: secure bastion host setup for controlled administrative access.  
  
cloudsql: deployment and configuration of Cloud SQL instances, including encryption, automated backups, and high availability.  
  
gke: provisioning and securing Google Kubernetes Engine clusters with compliance-focused configurations.  
  
iam: granular identity and access management (IAM) roles and policies, following least-privilege principles.  
  
iap: Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) integration to secure access to internal applications and resources.  
  
memorystore: managed Redis instances configured for high availability and failover.  
  
svc-projects: service project structure for workload separation and compliance enforcement.  
  
svpc: shared VPC configurations to enforce centralized network security controls.  
  
vpc-sc: VPC Service Controls for enhanced data exfiltration prevention and regulatory compliance.  
  
In addition, the Terraform configurations cover:  
  
IAM and role management: definition of custom roles, binding of service accounts, and strict access policies.  
  
Networking standards: VPCs, subnets, firewall rules, and routing aligned with internal security baselines.  
  
Monitoring and observability: Cloud Logging, Prometheus and alerting policies.  
  
High availability and disaster recovery (HA/DR): multi-region deployments, load balancing, backup strategies, and failover configurations.  
  
This codebase represents significant original authorship in both design and implementation. It is not a generic Terraform setup; it embodies the unique security, compliance, and operational requirements of ICEO as a financial services provider. Its architecture reflects original creative and technical contributions that directly serve our regulated business environment and therefore constitutes protected intellectual property.
