**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and [private] [private] of the software repository, and therefore the exclusive copyright holder of the work found at https://github.com/stanislasbdx/pterodactyl-egg-discord. I am acting directly on [private] [private] behalf to enforce the terms of the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0) under which the work was initially published.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work is a Pterodactyl Panel Egg and associated Dockerfile designed for hosting Discord bots built with Node.js and discord.js. This work was first published and licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0) on [private] GitHub repository: https://github.com/stanislasbdx/pterodactyl-egg-discord.

The infringement consists of a direct copy/derivative work that violates the core Copyleft provision of the GPL-3.0. The infringing repository has been illegally re-licensed under the permissive MIT License, which is incompatible with the GPL-3.0's requirement that all derivative works remain under the GPL-3.0. Furthermore, the infringing copy fails to comply with attribution requirements (Section 5) by omitting the original copyright notice.

Crucially, [private] attempted to resolve this issue amicably. [private] contacted the repository owner via email on November 17, 2025, informing them of the license violation and offering the option to comply or delete the repository. To date (December 10, 2025), [private] have received no response, forcing me to proceed with this formal DMCA Takedown Notice.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

https://github.com/stanislasbdx/pterodactyl-egg-discord

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

https://github.com/tristanbudd/pterodactyl-egg-discord

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

gnu-general-public-license-v3.0

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

Yes, I have the alleged infringer's contact information. [private] used the public email associated with their GitHub profile (if available) or the one provided on their [private] [private].

Email adress : [private]

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

The infringing repository can be brought into compliance by making the following mandatory changes, as required by the GPL-3.0:

1. Relicensing: The repository must be licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0), replacing the unauthorized MIT license.  
2. Attribution: The original copyright notice and credit must be added, clearly identifying the initial work's source (https://github.com/stanislasbdx/pterodactyl-egg-discord) and author.  
3. Notice of Changes: Any modified files must carry prominent notices stating that they have been modified and listing the relevant date of change (Section 5).

Alternatively, the user can resolve the infringement by making the repository private or deleting it entirely.
