Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization.  
I am the [private] and exclusive copyright holder of the Lua scripts contained in [private] original private repository. The repository was private and the code was written entirely by [private]. The infringing repository contains unauthorized copies of [private] copyrighted work.  
  
Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.  
The original copyrighted work consists of a collection of Lua scripts [private] authored. These scripts were stored in a private [private] repository that [private] own. The infringing repository contains unauthorized copies of [private] copyrighted work. Additionally, the infringer impersonated [private] and published the repository without [private] consent.  
  
If the original work is available online, please provide a URL.  
The original work is not publicly available; it resided in a private git repository and was eventually published under [private] account.  
  
We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing OR list specific files.  
The entire repository is infringing.  
  
Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:  
https://github.com/goose-birb/lua-buffoonery  
  
Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content?  
No.  
  
If you are reporting an infringing fork, list all fork URLs here:  
None.  
  
Is the work licensed under an open source license?  
No.  
  
What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?  
The reported content must be removed.  
  
Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information?  
I do not have the infringer’s contact information. The user had committed code under an unreachable email address.  
  
I have a good-faith belief that the use of the copyrighted materials described above is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.  
  
The original work was later published by [private] under a CC BY license on [private] own [private] account. However, the infringing repository predates [private] publication and was created without [private] permission. At the time the infringing repository was uploaded, [private] did not have a [private] account, and the infringer impersonated [private] and uploaded [private] private code without authorization. The infringing work was not published with any disclaimer, indication, or notice that it was intended as an educational tool. The infringer had no authorized access to the code prior to its legitimate publication, and therefore the infringing repository was never licensed or permitted.  
  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
