**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I own a [private] [private] repository on a project where the user [private] once had access to. We were originally working on an app idea together that did not materialize. I have recently discovered that [private] has copied [private] code into the public repo mentioned and on his personal website, [private], he claims that he is the one who developed the mobile app without any reference to [private]. [private] had developed the entire code for the app by [private], the only contribution that [private] has is when he tried to make changes to the codebase in an attempt to learn how to takeover the project from [private] and remove [private] from it. The instructions in the markdown file were written by [private]. The commit history in GitHub references [private] github user [private], which is tied to the same email that my [private] user is linked to, and my [private] [private] [private] [private] and my [private]. The commit history even contains a link to the original [private] repo. This should be sufficient evidence that the code belongs to [private].

In a previous message to Github, I had mentioned that the [private] [private] had been deleted, although I discovered that this was not the case as it still exists and is still private. He has copied and used this code without my knowledge or consent and presented himself as the creator of it without credit to [private] in order to promote his personal brand to employers, after we mutually agreed to dissolve the project.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

[private]

The project is private, but the URL is also referenced in the commit history of the github repo that copied it.

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The project is hosted in [private] in a [private] [private] that only a few people had access to. The project has been copied into GitHub by an individual whose access had been revoked without the knowledge of the original owner and without expressed consent and is claiming full ownership over the project.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The private repo has been copied into a public repo on a different platform than the original repo.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed
