**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

[private] the [private] [private] and [private] copyright holder of the 3D interactive portfolio created with Three.js, including all JavaScript code, 3D models, textures, animations, lighting, and interactive elements. I have full authority to submit this DMCA notice.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original work is a 3D interactive web portfolio created by [private]. It includes custom Three.js scene structure, original JavaScript code, unique 3D models, textures (including a clapperboard with [private] name [private]), animations, lighting, camera setups, and interactive elements. All of these assets and code were created by [private] and are being copied without permission.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

Original page: [private]  
Original repo: [private]

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/ar-ajsal/ar-ajsal-portfolio

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

mit-license

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The infringer copied [private] entire 3D portfolio code and assets, removed the MIT license and copyright notice, and is presenting the work as their own. This violates the MIT license requirement to include the copyright and license notice in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

To comply with the MIT license, the infringer would need to restore the original copyright notice and MIT license in all copied files and provide proper attribution to [private], the original author. Additionally, all 3D models and textures that are All Rights Reserved would need to be removed or properly licensed.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
