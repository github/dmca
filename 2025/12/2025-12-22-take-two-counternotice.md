**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am a [private] of the referenced repository and am authorized to act on behalf of the project and its contributors with respect to the content in this repository. The material in question consists of original source code authored by the project contributors and distributed under applicable open-source licenses.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The takedown notice referenced the entire repository rather than individual files.  
Repository URL: https://github.com/multitheftauto/mtasa-blue

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

The repository referenced contains only original, independently developed source code and supporting materials created by contributors to the project. It does not include, reproduce, or distribute any copyrighted assets, source code, or proprietary files from the original game or its publisher.

The software operates by interacting at runtime with a lawfully installed, user-supplied copy of the original game. No copyrighted game content is extracted, copied, redistributed, or included within this repository. The project does not replace the original game or function without it. We do not endorse using non original copies of the game.

This interaction exists solely to enable interoperability with legally obtained software and is documented as part of the project’s fair-use and interoperability policy, which expressly prohibits the inclusion or distribution of copyrighted game assets. All copyrighted material remains part of the user’s original installation.

Because the repository contains only original source code and facilitates lawful interoperability with software already owned by the user, the takedown appears to be the result of a mistake or misidentification of the materials hosted in the repository, rather than the presence of infringing content.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**
