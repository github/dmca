**Identify the copyrighted work**:

The original copyrighted work is [private] "stata-mcp" repository (https://github.com/sepinetam/stata-mcp), which contains original code, documentation, and implementation that [private] created as the [private] copyright holder.

**License History and Non-Compliance Issues**:

1. **License Change Timeline**:  
   - [private] repository was originally licensed under MIT License  
   - Approximately 4 months ago, [private] officially changed the license to Apache License 2.0  
   - This change occurred at version 1.6.1 with git commits 4ca8fe3 ("Update License") and dd01237 ("Update LICENSE")  
   - All code from version 1.6.1 through the current version 1.13.8 is under Apache License 2.0

2. **Evidence of Malicious Copyright Infringement**:

   The repository https://github.com/jackdark425/aigroup-stata-mcp exhibits the following malicious behaviors:

   a) **Complete Copy Outside Fork Process**:  
      - This repository was not created through GitHub's fork functionality  
      - Instead, it was created by cloning [private] entire project, deleting the original git history, and reinitializing with git init  
      - The git history shows only 10 commits, starting with "Initial commit: aigroup-stata-mcp project"  
      - This completely eliminates [private] development history and contribution records

   b) **Systematic Removal of Copyright Notices**:  
      - [private] original project includes copyright notices in the header of all Python files:  
        `# Copyright (C) [private]`  
        `# @Author : [private]`  
        `# @Email  : [private]`  
      - The infringing repository systematically removed these copyright notices from all Python files  
      - This constitutes deliberate copyright information removal

3. **Specific Apache License 2.0 Violations**:

   a) **Incorrect License Declaration**: The repository incorrectly declares MIT License while containing code that is under Apache License 2.0

   b) **Missing Apache License 2.0 Elements**:  
      - Does not include the complete Apache License 2.0 text  
      - Missing required copyright notice ("[private]")  
      - Fails to provide proper attribution to the original author

   c) **Violation of Apache License 2.0 Section 4**:  
      - Section 4(a): Fails to give recipients a copy of the Apache License 2.0  
      - Section 4(c): Does not retain copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the original work

   d) **Misrepresentation of Authorship**: The repository claims "jackdark425" as the maintainer/author, removing proper attribution to [private] as the original creator

4. **Evidence of Code Usage**:  
   The repository contains code features that were implemented after my v1.6.1 Apache License 2.0 change, including:  
   - MCP server implementation  
   - Stata integration functionality  
   - Data processing modules  
   - Configuration systems  
   - CLI interfaces  
   - These features were developed under Apache License 2.0 protection

**Why Current State is Infringement**:

The current repository does not comply with Apache License 2.0 requirements because:

1. **Deliberate Copyright Infringement**:  
   - Complete project replication through non-fork means, eliminating original author identity  
   - Systematic removal of all copyright notices from source code files  
   - Rewriting project history to falsely claim original authorship

 2. **License Incompatibility**:  
   - Distributing Apache License 2.0 protected code under MIT License terms  
   - Apache License 2.0 conflicts with MIT License, particularly in attribution and patent grant requirements

3. **Missing Legal Requirements**:  
   - Does not include the complete Apache License 2.0 text  
   - Lacks "[private]" copyright notice  
   - Removes attribution information from the original project

4. **Violation of Specific Apache License 2.0 Terms**:  
   - Section 4(a): Recipients do not receive a copy of the Apache License 2.0  
   - Section 4(b): Modified files do not include notices of changes  
   - Section 4(c): Does not retain original copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices

5. **False Author Attribution**:  
   - README and configuration files declare "jackdark425" as the project creator  
   - Completely removes my attribution as the original author  
   - This prevents users from identifying the actual copyright owner

**Action Requested**:

I request that GitHub promptly remove or disable access to the infringing repository:  
- https://github.com/jackdark425/aigroup-stata-mcp

The repository should remain disabled until it fully complies with Apache License 2.0 requirements.

I have a good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

I swear under penalty of perjury that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
