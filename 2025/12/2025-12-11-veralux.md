**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the copyright holder of the original script “VeraLux – HyperMetric Stretch”, licensed under GNU GPL-3.0-or-later. My copyright notice and license terms are included in the source files.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

My copyrighted work consists of the Python implementation of the VeraLux HyperMetric Stretch processing engine for Siril, including UI structure and core mathematical logic. This work is distributed exclusively under GPL-3.0-or-later.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/killerciao/VeraLuxPorting

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

gnu-general-public-license-v3.0

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

GNU GPL-3.0-or-later. This license requires preserving the original copyright notice and license terms, and prohibits relicensing under a more permissive license such as MIT. The infringing repository violates both requirements.  
The infringing repository removes my GPL header, substitutes a different license (MIT), and falsely presents the work as original. This violates GPL-3.0-or-later Section 4 (preservation of notices) and the DMCA definition of copyright removal.  
I previously opened a public issue in the infringing repository to request license compliance, but the request was ignored.
Therefore I am submitting this DMCA notice.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

To bring the project into compliance with the original license (GPL-3.0-or-later), the following actions are required:  
1. Restore [private] original copyright notice in all derivative source files:  [private].  
2. Apply the correct license across the entire repository. GPL-3.0-or-later is copyleft and cannot be replaced by the MIT license currently present.  
3. Add clear attribution in the README stating that the project is a port of my original work and include a link to my repository.  
4. Ensure no material derived from my code is presented as original or independently authored.

When these steps are completed, the project will be fully compliant and I will consider the matter resolved.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

no, I only know the alleged infringer’s GitHub identity:  
GitHub username: killerciao

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
