Dear Madame

DMCA Takedown Notice - https://github.com/aripuzo  

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice 

Gitghub user[private] a [private] citizen with [private] passport number [private], residing at [private], [private], [private], [private], with Github
account https://github.com/aripuzo stole and illegally published some of Boom Technologies' confidential intellectual property - including but not limited to https://github.com/aripuzo/boom-app-ios and https://github.com/aripuzo/boom-android.

The matter has been reported to law enforcement in [private] and Interpol.  

Attached is a copy of the complaint filed with [private] law enforcement and a copy of the [private] passport of the cyber-criminal.  

It would be best for Github to take-down this user’s account in its entirety as he may be holding other company's stolen intellectual property too.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.  

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Sincerely  
BOOM TECHNOLOGIES LTD
