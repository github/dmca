This constitutes a violation of intellectual property rights, privacy, and security policies.

The posted content is considered proprietary and confidential under Cisco and Splunk's intellectual property and data security policies. This information was taken and published without the consent of either party, and its presence on GitHub poses significant risks, including:  
1. Potential unauthorized access to our systems using exposed tokens.
