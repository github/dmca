**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
I am the [private] of Revere Development (“Revere Group”), which owns the copyright to the open-source project Alley and its associated source code, README, and branding materials.  
  
In my capacity as [private], I am authorized to act on behalf of Revere Development in matters of copyright protection and enforcement, including filing DMCA takedown notices.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**  
  
The copyrighted work is “Alley”, an open‑source project developed and maintained by Revere Development, primarily authored by [private] and [private].  
  
Alley is a custom Minecraft 1.8 Practice PvP core built for performance, scalability, and customization. The repository contains original source code and documentation, including a README file that outlines usage and licensing restrictions.  
  
Our terms prohibit commercial use without explicit permission and require attribution to the original authors.  
  
The infringing user, DaGameDevKer (email: [private]), previously contacted us requesting permission to use Alley commercially and asked for a development quote. We provided a price, after which he responded, quote:  
  
[private]
  
He explicitly stated he no longer intended to use the project, then later cloned our repository under the name “ansdousahdouha1390d”, deleted our README to remove authorship and license information, and attempted to disguise the repository.  
  
This demonstrates willful and knowing infringement, since he was fully aware of the license terms and intentionally attempted to circumvent them to use the project for free, while stripping credit.  
  
**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**  
  
**Based on the above, I confirm that:**  
  
The entire repository is infringing  
  
**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**  
  
https://github.com/DaGameDevKer/ansdousahdouha1390d  
  
**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**  
  
No  
  
**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**  
  
**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**  
  
Yes  
  
**Which license?**  
  
other  
  
**How do you believe the license is being violated?**  
  
The repository in question is a direct copy of our project “Alley”, originally distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution‑NonCommercial‑ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY‑NC‑SA 4.0) license.  
  
The infringer (DaGameDevKer) violated this license in the following ways:  
  
1. Removal of attribution – they deleted our README file and license notice, erasing all reference to the original authors ([private], [private], and Revere Development), which is required under Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i–v) of the license.  
2. Misrepresentation of ownership – the repository was renamed to a random hash (“ansdousahdouha1390d”) to obscure its identity and origin.  
3. Commercial intent – the individual previously requested permission to use the software commercially, was denied after refusing our pricing terms (“Nope too expensive idc anymore”), and then cloned the project regardless, indicating an attempt to circumvent the “NonCommercial” clause (Section 2(a)(1)).  
  
These actions collectively represent a deliberate and knowing violation of the CC BY‑NC‑SA 4.0 license and a breach of copyright law.  
  
**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**  
  
To bring the infringing repository into compliance, the user must:  
  
1. Restore attribution and licensing information - reinstate our full README and copyright/license notice exactly as published in the original repository.  
2. Acknowledge the original authors and repository - include credit to Revere Development (https://www.revere.dev) and the authors [private] and [private] per the license.  
3. Ensure the repository is not used for commercial purposes  
  
Alternatively, if the infringer does not intend to comply, they should make the repository private or delete it to avoid further infringement.  
  
**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**  
  
Yes.
