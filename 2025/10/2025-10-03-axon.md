Provide contact information, if you know it, for the alleged infringer.

GitHub User Name: AnonAuto  
Infringing Repository: https://github.com/AnonAuto/Axon

Identify the copyrighted work you believe has been infringed.  
Identify the material that you allege is infringing the copyrighted work listed in item #2, above.

This entire repository has been created for the sole purpose of reverse engineering and infringing Axon's copyrighted software and works. The owner of this repository does not attempt to hide these facts. The owner states under the "Axon Repository" heading: "Documenting the reverse engineering of Axon Enterprise Devices, Protocols, Software, Firmware and Mobile Applications looking for secrets and vulnerabilitites. This work is unauthorised and done by members of the Anonymous Automotive Alliance." The owner then proceeds to explain how exactly they reverse engineered and copied Axon's software without permission - see attached screenshot of the repository in full. This user and repository are clearly in violation of the Copyright Act and must be banned and removed from GitHub. Axon also notes that this user is attempting to publish private information about Axon to create a targeted security risk for Axon, in violation of GitHub's Terms of Service (see https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/github-private-information-removal-policy).

For example, at least the following links have been identified as containing copyrighted works owned by Axon:

Explain what the affected user would need to do in order to remedy the infringement.

This entire repository must be removed and this user should be banned from GitHub. There is nothing the owner can do to remedy the infringement short of deleting all content and ceasing its efforts to reverse engineer and impermissibly copy Axon's copyrighted software in its attempt to create a security risk for Axon.
