The repository I am going to share is our proprietary frontend and backend source code for our web application "Powerful Tools" The code governs the application's user interface, user management and administrative dashboard.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

Our original work was created ending June 2025 and has been developed privately on our local systems and google AI studio since then. The code has never be licensed for puplic use. The infringer's repository was uploaded on 17-11-2025 at around 9:00 AM. Our [private] [private] [private] [private], linked below, was created [private], [private] at around [private]. It was created after we discovered the ingringement, for the sole purpose of identifying our original work for this DMCA claim, as required by this form. The file timestamps on our local development machines and google studio version control and created history, prove our prior creation and ownership, predating the infringing repository by several months. We can provide the screenshots of the file metadata and historical commits from our private systems upon request to prove our claim.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Our copyrighted work is the proprietary source code for our commercial web application. It is not open-source and has never been licensed for public distribution. Our technological measures consist of strict access controls to prevent unauthorized access to this source code. These measures include:
Private Systems: The source code is maintained exclusively on private, non-public, and access-restricted development machines and systems. It is not hosted on any public repository or server.  
Authentication: Access to these development systems is protected by user authentication controls, including passwords required for all authorized personnel.
Network Security: Our development environments are protected by firewalls and are not exposed to the public internet, preventing general public access.
These measures are effective because they ensure that only authorized developers within our organization can view, copy, or modify the copyrighted source code, thereby controlling access to the material.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project circumvents our technological protection measures by making our private, copyrighted source code publicly available on GitHub, thereby bypassing all of our access controls.  
The infringer gained unauthorized access to our private files and systems where the code was securely stored. This act of unauthorized access is, by definition, a circumvention of the authentication and network security measures we have in place.  
While the precise vector of the unauthorized access is under investigation, the outcome—the public posting of our private code—is definitive proof that our technological measures were illegally circumvented. The infringer did not have permission or legitimate means to access or distribute this material. Evidence of this circumvention is that the infringer has only posted a subset of our files (the frontend code), indicating a partial but damaging breach of our private systems.
