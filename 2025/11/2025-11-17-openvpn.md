Dear Sir or Madam:

 

My name is [private], and I am [private] of OpenVPN, Inc. (“OpenVPN”).  On behalf of OpenVPN and pursuant to the Digital Millenium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”), I am submitting this notice to GitHub, Inc. (“GitHub”) to remove certain repositories containing crack codes that are designed to circumvent the technical measures OpenVPN has put in place to prevent unauthorized use of OpenVPN’s software.

 

I have read and understand GitHub’s Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice and am providing you with the following information relevant to this notice.

 

Identification of the Infringed Work.  The work being infringed is OpenVPN Access Server, of which OpenVPN owns all copyrights.  OpenVPN Access Server is an enterprise-grade business software solution that provides users of an unsecured network with a securely encrypted connection to the internet through a virtual private network.  A more detailed description of OpenVPN Access Server is at https://openvpn.net/access-server/.
 

OpenVPN makes available a trial or demonstration version of OpenVPN Access Server free of charge that contains code limiting the number of users to two simultaneous active VPN tunnels to the virtual private network.  The trial or demonstration version can be downloaded at the following link: https://myaccount.openvpn.com/signup/as.  If a customer wants to have more of its users access active VPN tunnels simultaneously, that customer may purchase additional user licenses from OpenVPN.  The license fees OpenVPN charges are based on the number of additional user licenses the customer purchases. 

 

Identification of the Infringing Material and Location.  OpenVPN uses technical measures to prevent users from accessing more than two VPN access tunnels simultaneously without buying user licenses.  These technical measures consist of a locking code (“Locking Code”) that prevents simultaneous access by more than that number of users.  If a customer purchases additional user licenses from OpenVPN, OpenVPN provides the customer with a license code that unlocks the Locking Code, which then permits the customer’s users to simultaneously access additional active VPN tunnels. 
 

The GitHub repositories in question contain computer programs (“Crack Codes”) and instructions to disable the Locking Code.  A user of these Crack Codes is able to access a potentially unlimited number of simultaneous active VPN access tunnels without paying a license fee to OpenVPN.  These GitHub repositories exist solely to circumvent the technological measures OpenVPN has put in place to control access to OpenVPN Access Server, thereby infringing OpenVPN’s rights in this copyrighted work under 17 U.S.C § 1201(a)(1) of the DMCA.

 

The repository on which the infringing material was initially posted is the following: 

 

https://github.com/khuong-nv/crack_openvpn_access_server
