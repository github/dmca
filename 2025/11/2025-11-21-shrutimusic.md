MIT License  

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**  
The infringing repository https://github.com/ZoxxOP/AnanyaMusic is a direct copy of [private] public project https://github.com/NoxxOP/ShrutiMusic (whole repository structure, source files, code and comments). The infringer removed [private] copyright notice and the MIT license text and replaced attribution with their own name.  

Under the MIT License, “The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.”  
Source: https://opensource.org/license/mit/  

By removing [private] copyright and license text, the infringer has violated the MIT License terms and misrepresented authorship.  

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license?**  
To comply with the MIT license, the infringing repository must either:  
1. Restore the original LICENSE (MIT) file and [private] copyright/attribution in all files copied from ShrutiMusic, and preserve commit history where possible; OR  
2. Remove all copied content from https://github.com/ZoxxOP/AnanyaMusic.
