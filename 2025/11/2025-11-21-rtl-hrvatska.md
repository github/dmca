Dear GitHub DMCA Agent,  
   
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. We, Warezio s.r.o., acting as  
copyright agent on behalf of company RTL Hrvatska d.o.o.. We represent clients who own or hold  
exclusive licenses to copyrighted audiovisual content, including live television broadcasts and IPTV  
streams.  
   
Section 40(1)(c) of the Czech Copyright Act establishes a direct statutory obligation for certain  
intermediaries and service providers to disclose specified information to a copyright holder whose  
rights have been infringed or are at risk of infringement. We therefore kindly request that you  
disclose the following information about [private] (username [private]), who is the  
author of this repository:  
   
- full postal address  
- email address  
- phone number  
- all IP addresses used for the registration and for any subsequent access to the account  
- devices, operating systems and browsers used to access the account and your services  
- history of changes made to the account (such as changes of email address, name, address,  
etc.)  
   
We kindly ask you to provide the above information within seven (7) days of receipt of this request.  
   
1. Identification of the Copyrighted Work Claimed to Have Been Infringed:  
   
The copyrighted works at issue are live IPTV streams of television channels and programming owned  
or exclusively licensed by our clients. These include, but are not limited to, premium and pay-perview channels that are protected under copyright law. Our clients hold valid copyrights for the  
distribution and streaming of this content, and unauthorized linking to or distribution of these  
streams constitutes infringement.  
   
2. Identification of the Material That Is Claimed to Be Infringing and Where It Is Located:  
   
The entire repository at https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv is dedicated to collecting and distributing  
links to IPTV streams, the most of which are unauthorized and infringe on copyrights. The repository  
knowingly includes links to illegal IPTV streams, and its core purpose is built upon these infringing  
activities. Specific infringing materials include, but are not limited to, the following URLs found in the  
repository's playlist files:  
   
RTL Hrvatska d.o.o.  
   
• https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv/blob/master/streams/hr.m3u  
• #EXTINF:-1 tvg-id="RTL.hr@SD",RTL (1080p)  
• https://bpcdnmanprod.nexttv.ht.hr/bpk-tv/RTL/default/index.mpd  
• #EXTINF:-1 tvg-id="RTL2.hr@SD",RTL 2 (1080p)  
• https://bpcdnmanprod.nexttv.ht.hr/bpk-tv/RTL2/default/index.mpd  
• #EXTINF:-1 tvg-id="RTLCroatiaWorld.hr@SD",RTL Croatia (1080p)  
• https://d1cs5tlhj75jxe.cloudfront.net/rtl/playlist.m3u8  
• #EXTINF:-1 tvg-id="RTLKockica.hr@SD",RTL Kockica (1080p)  
• https://d1rzyyum8t0q1e.cloudfront.net/rtl-kockica/playlist.m3u8  
   
These URLs directly link to unauthorized streams of our clients' copyrighted content without  
permission. The repository facilitates widespread infringement by aggregating and maintaining these  
links.  
   
3. Explanation of What the Affected User Would Need to Do to Remedy the Infringement:  
To remedy the infringement, the user must remove all infringing URLs and cease all activities related  
to collecting or distributing links to unauthorized IPTV streams. However, given that the repository's  
entire purpose is based on these infringing links and the facilitation of illegal activities, no partial  
remedy is sufficient. The only adequate remedy is the complete and permanent deletion of the  
repository.  
   
Furthermore, the repository's issues section contains over 11,900 closed issues containing the  
keyword "Add" (searchable at[private]), where users request the addition of further undeniably pirated channels. These issues are moderated and approved by the repository  
maintainers, who are fully aware of the infringing nature of the content. This demonstrates willful  
and ongoing facilitation of copyright infringement. The entire repository infringes on copyrights and  
should be considered as a whole for removal, as its primary function is to enable access to pirated  
streams.  
   
Please note that this repository not only violates copyright law but also GitHub Acceptable Use  
Policies by promoting and facilitating illegal activities, such as the distribution of pirated content.
