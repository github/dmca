**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] at Systems X, authorized to act on behalf of the company in matters relating to intellectual property protection and security incidents. Systems X is the sole copyright owner of the proprietary Chrome Extension software that was developed under contract for our exclusive internal use.  
The infringing repository contains our company's proprietary source code, including custom API integrations, authentication mechanisms, and business logic developed specifically for Systems X's manufacturing operations. This code was created as a work-for-hire under our contract with [private] (the repository owner), making Systems X the exclusive copyright holder of all code and related materials.  
The repository was created by a former offshore contractor ([private]) who was explicitly prohibited from retaining, publishing, or distributing any of our
proprietary code after contract termination. The unauthorized public posting of this repository violates our contractual agreements and our copyright ownership.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work is a proprietary Chrome Extension application developed exclusively for Systems X to facilitate secure data retrieval and display from our Plex ERP manufacturing system. This software is now in production.

The Chrome Extension includes the following copyrighted components:  
1. Custom API Integration Layer: Proprietary code that interfaces with Plex ERP's Data Source API, including authentication handlers, request/response processing logic, and error handling mechanisms specifically designed for our manufacturing data workflows.  
2. Authentication and Security Module: Custom implementation of secure credential management, token handling, and session management tailored to our internal security requirements.  
3. User Interface Components: Original front-end code including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that creates custom interfaces for managing workcenter metrics, production tracking data, and operational analytics.  
4. Backend Route Handlers: Express.js server-side routing logic in files such as workcenterRoutes.js that processes API requests and manages data flow between the Chrome Extension frontend and Plex ERP backend systems.  
5. Business Logic: Proprietary algorithms and data processing routines that transform raw manufacturing data into actionable metrics specific to Systems X's operational requirements.

The entire codebase, architecture, file structure, and implementation details represent original creative expression developed specifically for Systems X under a work-for-hire arrangement. The software contains Systems X's proprietary business logic, custom integrations, and the client systems access information.

This work is confidential and was never intended for public disclosure or distribution. All development was performed under strict confidentiality agreements that prohibited the contractor from retaining, copying, or publishing any portion of the code after contract termination.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Systems X implements multiple layers of technological access controls to protect
our copyrighted Chrome Extension software:

1. Source Code Repository Access Controls:  
- The legitimate version of our Chrome Extension is stored in private,  
access-controlled repositories with authentication required for all access  
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) required for repository access  
- Role-based access control (RBAC) limiting code access to authorized personnel only  
- All contractor access is immediately revoked upon contract termination  
  
2. Azure Cloud Infrastructure Protection:  
- Azure Active Directory authentication required for all system access  
- Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies restricting access to authorized  
users only  
- Conditional access policies enforcing security requirements  
  
3. Network-Level Access Controls:  
- Azure SQL Database firewall rules restricting database connections to exactly  
113 documented and authorized IP addresses  
- No public access (0.0.0.0/0) permitted at any time  
- IP allowlisting ensures only known, legitimate sources can connect to backend  
systems  
- Network security groups (NSGs) controlling traffic flow  
  
4. Application-Level Security:  
- API authentication tokens required for all Plex ERP data access  
- Session management and token expiration mechanisms  
- Encrypted transmission of all data (HTTPS/TLS)  
  
5. Operational Security Measures:  
- Confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with all contractors  
- Contractual prohibitions against code retention, copying, or publication  
- Formal offboarding procedures, including access revocation and code review  

These technological measures effectively control access by ensuring that only authorized personnel with valid credentials, from approved network locations, can access our copyrighted software and associated systems. The infringing repository circumvents these controls by publicly exposing our proprietary code that should only be accessible by authorized personnel.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project circumvents our technological protection measures by making our proprietary source code publicly accessible on GitHub without any access controls, authentication requirements, or authorization checks.

Specifically, the circumvention occurs through:

1. Public Repository Exposure: The contractor configured the repository as "public" on GitHub, thereby bypassing all of our private repository access controls, authentication requirements, and IP allowlisting restrictions. This allows anyone on the internet to view, download, and copy our proprietary code without authorization.

2. Unauthorized Code Retention and Publication: Despite contractual obligations to delete all copies of our proprietary code upon contract termination, the contractor retained the code and published it to a public platform, circumventing our operational security controls that require immediate access revocation and code deletion at engagement conclusion.

3. Exposure of Embedded Credentials: The repository contains 23 hardcoded API credentials and authentication tokens that were intended to remain secured within our private infrastructure. Public exposure of these credentials further circumvents our authentication and credential management security measures.

The design of making the repository public fundamentally undermines and bypasses every access control measure we implemented to protect our copyrighted material.  
What should require Azure AD authentication, authorized IP addresses, and explicit permissions now requires nothing more than an internet connection.
