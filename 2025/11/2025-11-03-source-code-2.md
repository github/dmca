If you use a personal email address for a notice submitted on behalf of a company, we may not be able to process it.**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] [private] and copyright holder of the code and other materials in the repository.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original work is a software repository containing source code and other assets for a project [private] developed, named [AppPorter]. I am the [private] of this work.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

The original repository is located at [[private]].  
Please note: This repository was previously public, which is when the infringing copy was made. [private] have since set [private] [private] to [private] to revoke public access. As the copyright owner, this is [private] authoritative copy. The [private] team should be able to verify [private] ownership and the content of this private repository.

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/itsharex/AppPorter

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

I have set [private] [private] [private]'s visibility to "[private]". This is a standard feature provided by [private] that uses access control mechanisms to ensure that only I and explicitly authorized collaborators can view, access, or clone the repository's content. This effectively prevents the general public from accessing [private] copyrighted material through its original source location.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused repository is a fork that was created when [private] repository was public. By keeping this fork public after [private] have employed [private]'s "[private]" feature to restrict access to the original work, the accused party is circumventing my technological measure. Their public repository provides an unauthorized gateway to my copyrighted content, directly undermining the access control [private] have put in place on the original repository.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

https://github.com/itsharex/AppPorter

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

mozilla-public-license-2.0

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

While the fork was initially permissible under the license, [private] decision to make the original repository private constitutes a withdrawal of the code from public distribution under [private] authority as the copyright holder. Continued public hosting against [private] explicit action of making it [private] is not authorized.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

The repository must be deleted entirely.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No, the organization's profile does not provide any contact information.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
