**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] [private] and copyright holder of OkMap, a proprietary mapping and GPS software developed by [private].  
[private] own all rights to its source code, binaries, and licensing system.  
I am therefore authorized to submit this DMCA takedown notice directly.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work is the software "OkMap", a proprietary mapping and GPS navigation application developed by [private].  
OkMap allows users to create, view, and analyze maps, GPS tracks, and waypoints, and includes advanced GIS and outdoor navigation features.  
All source code, executables, and license protection mechanisms are original and owned by [private].  
The infringing repository distributes an unauthorized crack that removes or bypasses OkMap’s license protection, enabling illegal use of the software.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

https://www.okmap.org/

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://gist.github.com/imuninchikr2/f504a464d5ac9de9d332f3df11f45154

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

OkMap includes a license management system that requires a valid activation key to unlock the full version of the software.  
Without this key, the application runs in limited mode and certain features remain disabled.  
The crack distributed in the infringing repository removes or bypasses the license verification routine, allowing users to access the full functionality without authorization.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project is designed to circumvent OkMap’s license protection by modifying the software or providing unauthorized tools that disable or bypass the license verification. It enables users to access the full version of OkMap without entering a valid license key.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

The alleged infringer appears to be the GitHub user "imuninchikr2".  
Their profile (https://github.com/imuninchikr2) currently shows no public repositories.  
I do not have any additional contact details for this user.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**
