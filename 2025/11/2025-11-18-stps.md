Dear GitHub Trust & Safety Team,  
Thank you for your response and for allowing us to clarify the extent of the infringement.  
  
The entire repository infringes copyright, as it contains and reproduces, without authorization, technical and documentary materials belonging to the Sistema de Inteligencia de Datos para la Inspección Laboral (SIDIL) — a system owned by the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (STPS) of the Government of Mexico.  
  
The content published in the repository https://github.com/anhdzol/manual-sidil  
includes documentation, system structure, and descriptive content that are part of the official SIDIL system, which was developed in collaboration with the American Institutes for Research (AIR) under a formal technical cooperation agreement.  
  
This documentation was created exclusively for internal institutional use within STPS and contains detailed information on data architecture, processes, and methodologies that form part of the Government of Mexico’s official technological infrastructure. Its unauthorized publication on GitHub constitutes a direct violation of copyright law and the lawful use of restricted government material.  
  
Accordingly, we respectfully request that GitHub remove the entire repository https://github.com/anhdzol/manual-sidil  
and any derivative or associated content, in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and GitHub’s Copyright Policy.  
  
Thank you for your attention and prompt handling of this matter. Please let us know if any further information is required to complete the takedown process.  
  
Sincerely,
