**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
I am the [private] and copyright owner of the Hayase project code, published under the Business Source License 1.1 (BUSL 1.1) across multiple repositories in the hayase-app GitHub organization.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**  
  
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.  
  
The original copyrighted work is the Hayase application - a desktop torrent client that [private] developed and published under the Business Source License 1.1 (BUSL 1.1).  
  
The BUSL 1.1 is a source-available license that explicitly restricts:  
- Commercial use without a separate commercial license  
- Redistribution under different license terms  
- Use in production environments without purchasing a license  
- Any use that competes with the licensor's product  
  
[private] have never granted the user RockinChaos or anyone else a commercial license, nor have they purchased one from [private].  
  
While specific infringing files include:  
  
1. **https://github.com/RockinChaos/Shiru/blob/248b15c368fcf8b543021034ce30fcdc6796ef15/common/components/visual/SmartIFrame.svelte**  
- Copied from: https://github.com/hayase-app/interface/blob/master/src/lib/components/ui/cards/YoutubeIframe.svelte  
  
2. **https://github.com/RockinChaos/Shiru/blob/d217fdecd2912837fa4947b6c9171b95c597c76e/common/components/visual/RichContent.svelte**  
- Copied from: https://github.com/hayase-app/interface/blob/master/src/lib/components/Shadow.svelte

- Copied from: https://github.com/hayase-app/torrent-client/blob/main/attachments.ts  
  
4. **Parts of https://github.com/RockinChaos/Shiru/blob/master/client/lib/metadata.js**  
- Copied from: https://github.com/hayase-app/torrent-client/blob/main/attachments.ts  
  
5. **https://github.com/RockinChaos/Shiru/blob/master/electron/src/preload/preload.js#L45-L80**  
- Copied from: https://github.com/hayase-app/electron/blob/main/src/preload/index.ts  
  
6. **https://github.com/RockinChaos/Shiru/blob/master/capacitor/src/preload/preload.js#L162-L206**  
- Copied from: https://github.com/hayase-app/capacitor/blob/main/src/preload.ts#L325-L414  
  
The infringing code is so deeply intertwined throughout the repository's commit history (particularly in commit https://github.com/RockinChaos/Shiru/commit/4d5432524fdab4feca4f15b661caac2cb69ec91d) and has been subsequently modified and built upon in later commits, that surgical removal of individual files is not feasible.  
  
Additionally, this infringing code has been compiled and distributed to end users in production releases:  
- https://github.com/RockinChaos/Shiru/releases/tag/v6.2.0  
- https://github.com/RockinChaos/Shiru/releases/tag/v6.2.1  
  
Their repository has taken [private] BUSL 1.1 licensed code, redistributed it under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0), and shipped it to users as a competing product - all without authorization or a commercial license. This constitutes production use of [private] BUSL 1.1 code without a license, which is explicitly prohibited.  
  
**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**  
  
The code is available across multiple repositories in the hayase-app organization:  
  
- https://github.com/hayase-app/interface  
- https://github.com/hayase-app/torrent-client  
- https://github.com/hayase-app/electron

No  
  
**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**
