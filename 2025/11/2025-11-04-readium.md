Readium LCP is a DRM solution, i.e. a set of technological measures of copyright protection through copy control and encryption. Ebook distributors, e.g. public libraries and online booksellers, are using LCP to limit the dates between which a publication can be read, the number of characters a user is able to copy/paste or the number of pages a user may print. They can also control that the content is not overshared.

The core LCP specification ([https://readium.org/lcp-specs/releases/lcp/latest](https://readium.org/lcp-specs/releases/lcp/latest)) defines the notion of encryption profiles. Encryption profiles are a way to include a secret algorithm in an otherwise open solution, secrets being the basis of effective technical measures of protection.

We are the copyright owner of the official LCP encryption profiles used by ebook distributors worldwide. More information about our role relative to LCP is found in [https://www.edrlab.org/readium-lcp/](https://www.edrlab.org/readium-lcp/). LCP adopters are listed in [https://www.edrlab.org/readium-lcp/certified-apps-servers/](https://www.edrlab.org/readium-lcp/certified-apps-servers/).

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The LCP encryption profiles, their algorithm and associated keys are not posted online, nor open in any manner. Instead they must be licensed through an explicit agreement with EDRLab.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/abustany/lcp-decrypt

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The protection is based on the encryption of each resource of a publication. Without going into details of the LCP technological measures, only trusted LCP compliant client applications can give access to unencrypted content. In order to decrypt such encrypted content, LCP compliant applications use a user passphrase and a secret algorithm which is part of the LCP encryption Profile. LCP-compliant client applications cannot save decrypted ebooks.

LCP possesses several interesting characteristics:

- This DRM solution is available on every client platform (iOS, Android, Windows, MacOS, Linux, specific eInk Readers); with the open-source Readium development toolkits, EDRLab provides an open-source codebase, which eases such integration. LCP does not lock the user into a proprietary environment. This is why e-lending libraries are moving to this solution, worldwide.

- The DRM solution is especially useful for library e-lending, as it provides loan extensions and early return features.

- This DRM solution does not hurt the accessibility of the content it protects, for people with reading impairment; this is why is it promoted by the DAISY Consortium.

- This DRM solution lets users share LCP protected ebooks with friends and family; there is no predefined number of devices which can use an LCP protected ebook.

- This is the only DRM solution that is an international standard. This means that inspecting the software for flaws is easy. The encryption profile is the only confidential information.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The user has published on GitHub software which specifically allows the decryption of ebooks protected by the LCP DRM and allows saving them as non-protected ebooks. This infringement violates our legal business, and affects authors and publishers’ IP. 

The file which explicitly deals with LCP circumvention is:

https://github.com/abustany/lcp-decrypt/blob/master/pkg/lcp/lcp.go  
It contains Go code that implements a hack of the Readium LCP DRM. 

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**
