We are submitting this counter notice regarding the recent DMCA takedown of our repository Soncresity-Industries/SChat-Tweak.

Initially, we received a DMCA Takedown Request from the [private] of the [private] Repository ([private]), asking us to make specific modifications to our fork, which originated from their project.  
We immediately responded on the same day, confirming that the requested changes were underway, and implemented those changes within the given deadline.

Subsequently, we received a second DMCA Takedown Request requiring us to remove all related content from our repositories, including build artifacts and release files.  
We fully complied with this request:  
* All relevant content was removed from Soncresity-Industries/SChat-Tweak,  
* The affected release files were deleted,  
* Our fork of OpenInDiscord was permanently removed,  
* The SChat-Tweak repository was recreated from scratch to ensure no residual code remained.

Afterward, we recompiled the project using only our own source code, ensuring that no code or binary content from OpenInDiscord was included in any way.

Despite this complete compliance and cooperation, our repository has once again been taken down under the claim that we “did not follow instructions.”  
This is inaccurate — we followed every instruction given to us promptly and within one business day of receiving the requests.  
At this point, this situation appears to constitute an abuse of the DMCA Takedown process, as we have acted in good faith, promptly, and transparently in addressing every concern raised by the original copyright holder.

We therefore respectfully request the reinstatement of our repository, as it no longer contains any infringing content, nor does it violate the original DMCA claim in any capacity.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**

**Please confirm that you have you have read our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Counter Notice</a>.**

**So that the complaining party can get back to you, please provide both your telephone number and physical address.**
