I am filing this DMCA takedown on [private] own behalf as the rightful owner and original author of the repository ShrutixMusic hosted at https://github.com/NoxxOP/ShrutixMusic.  
This project is licensed under the MIT License and publicly released by [private] with full authorship rights and copyright notices.

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**  
The entire repository is infringing.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**  
Yes  
  
**Which license?**  
MIT License  
  
**How do you believe the license is being violated?**  
The infringing repository (https://github.com/ZoxxOP/AnanyaxMusic) is a full unauthorized copy of [private] original open-source project (https://github.com/NoxxOP/ShrutixMusic).    
The infringer has taken [private] complete repository, modified metadata, removed all credits, deleted [private] MIT license file, and replaced [private] name and project identifiers with their own. Even [private] channel, group, and developer references have been deliberately removed.  
  
Specific examples of removed attribution and license violations include:  
- https://github.com/ZoxxOP/AnanyaxMusic/blob/f6ee572c6c53dd79b13948824b7ee1ec79acde72/AnanyaxMusic/plugins/tools/dev.py#L214 — [private] developer ID and credit removed.  
- https://github.com/ZoxxOP/AnanyaxMusic/blob/main/AnanyaxMusic/core/userbot.py — [private] group and channel credit removed.  
- https://github.com/ZoxxOP/AnanyaxMusic/blob/main/AnanyaxMusic/main.py — module-level author credit deleted.  
- https://github.com/ZoxxOP/AnanyaxMusic/blob/main/.GitHub/ReadMe.MD — README edited to remove [private] author and project name.  
  
The entire repository code structure, file names, and function logic are direct copies of [private] original ShrutixMusic project, only with superficial renaming and license removal.  
  
Under the MIT License, the following clause is mandatory:  
“The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.”  
  
By removing [private] name, copyright headers, and license, and redistributing the full codebase under their own identity, the infringer has violated the MIT License and misrepresented authorship of [private] original work.  
  
**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license?**  
To bring the infringing repository (https://github.com/ZoxxOP/AnanyaxMusic) into compliance, the following actions are required:  
  
1. Restore the full MIT License file from [private] original repository: https://github.com/NoxxOP/ShrutixMusic    
2. Reinstate all author and project credits ([private] name: [private]) that were removed from files, modules, and documentation.    
3. Acknowledge the original author clearly in the README or main documentation file.    
4. Restore developer IDs, channels, and group references that were deleted.    
  
If these corrections are not made, I request that GitHub fully disable or remove the infringing repository.  
  
**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information?**  
No, I do not have their contact information.  
  
**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**  
  
**I have taken fair use into consideration.**  
  
**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**  
  
**I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice.**
