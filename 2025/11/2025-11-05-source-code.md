**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] [private] and copyright owner of the work in question. [private] created this work [private] and hold all rights to it.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work is a proprietary software application called "[private]" that [private] developed and maintain. This is a commercial algorithm practice tool hosted in [private] [private] [private] at [private].
The software is a comprehensive web service application designed to assist users with algorithm problem practice and coding exercises. The application includes:

- Original source code written primarily in TypeScript and JavaScript  
- Proprietary algorithms and problem-solving logic  
- Custom user interface components for algorithm practice  
- Backend API services for managing practice sessions and user data  
- Database schemas for storing problems, solutions, and user progress  
- Frontend components built with modern JavaScript frameworks  
- Configuration files and deployment scripts  
- Documentation and user guides

This work represents significant original creative and technical effort developed over an extended period. The software is distributed as a commercial product with licensing restrictions and is protected by copyright. The codebase contains proprietary features, unique implementations, and specialized functionality specifically designed for algorithm learning and practice.

The software is not open source and is not licensed for free distribution, modification, or reverse engineering. All rights are reserved, and unauthorized copying, distribution, cracking, or redistribution is strictly prohibited. The alleged infringement involves unauthorized distribution of a cracked version of this proprietary software.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

The original work is hosted in a [private] [private] [private] and is not publicly accessible. The repository URL is [private], but access is restricted to authorized users only.

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The [private] software implements multiple technological measures to control access to the copyrighted material:

1. **User Authentication System**: The software requires valid user credentials and login authentication to access the application and its features.

2. **License Verification**: The software includes license validation mechanisms that verify legitimate software licenses before allowing access to the full functionality.

3. **Access Control Mechanisms**: The application implements role-based access controls that restrict certain features and content to authorized users only.

4. **Session Management**: The software uses secure session tokens and time-based access controls to manage user sessions and prevent unauthorized access.

5. **API Authentication**: Backend services require proper authentication tokens and API keys to access data and functionality.

6. **Code Protection**: The software includes measures to prevent unauthorized copying and reverse engineering of the proprietary algorithms and business logic.

These technological measures effectively control access by ensuring that only legitimate, paying customers with valid licenses can access and use the software's features and content. The cracked version circumvents these protection mechanisms, allowing unauthorized users to access the copyrighted material without proper licensing or payment.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project circumvents our technological protection measures through several methods:

1. **License Bypass**: The cracked version removes or modifies the license verification code, allowing users to run the software without valid licenses or payment.

2. **Authentication Removal**: The project has disabled or bypassed the user authentication system, eliminating the requirement for legitimate user credentials to access the software.

3. **Protection Code Modification**: The cracked version contains modified code that removes or disables the built-in copy protection and access control mechanisms.

4. **API Security Bypass**: The project circumvents API authentication requirements, allowing unauthorized access to backend services and data that should be restricted to paying customers.

5. **Session Control Removal**: The cracked version removes session management and time-based access controls, providing unrestricted access to all features.

6. **Reverse Engineering**: The project appears to have reverse-engineered our proprietary protection mechanisms specifically to defeat them and enable unauthorized distribution.

The entire purpose of this cracked version is to circumvent our legitimate technological protection measures and provide free, unauthorized access to our commercial software, thereby enabling copyright infringement and causing financial harm to our business.
