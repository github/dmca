1) I, [private], am the copyright holder of the material being  
infringed.  
  
2) Nature of copyright ownership:  
I am the [private] and copyright holder of the paid software  
works:  
- "Euphoria Theme," a customizable theme for the Pterodactyl panel built  
using the Blueprint Framework, sold exclusively through Euphoria  
Development.  
  
[private] authorship details are embedded in the legitimate source files and  
conf.yml of the official versions, serving as verifiable proof of  
authorship and ownership. The infringing repositories have publicly  
uploaded [private] copyrighted code and design logic without authorization or  
purchase.  
  
3) Detailed description of the original works:  
The copyrighted works include proprietary HTML/CSS/JS/PHP layouts,  
styling, logic, and assets specifically designed for Pterodactyl panel  
customization. Redistribution is prohibited under the terms of purchase.  
  
Original legitimate version (for verification):  
- https://builtbybit.com/resources/euphoria.52856/  
- https://www.sourcexchange.net/products/euphoriatheme  
  
4) Location(s) of infringing material on GitHub:  
-  
https://github.com/AstroVoidLabsDev-Beta/euphoriatheme-Installation/blob/main/euphoriatheme.blueprint  
- https://github.com/AstroVoidLabsDev-Beta/euphoriatheme-Installation  
- https://github.com/ryzenpy/nebula/blob/main/euphoriatheme.blueprint

- https://github.com/ZtexXx/Euthopia/blob/main/euphoriatheme.blueprint  
- https://github.com/ZtexXx/Euthopia/blob/main/eu.blueprint  
  
The entire contents of these repositories are infringing.  
  
5) Technological protection measures:  
The original copyrighted resources are distributed exclusively through  
secure online marketplaces that require verified accounts and completed  
purchases to access downloads. This controlled system effectively limits  
access to authorized buyers only.  
  
6) Circumvention of those measures:  
The infringing repositories publicly upload and distribute [private] paid  
products' full source code and assets, bypassing purchase requirements  
and making the copyrighted material freely available to the public. This  
circumvents the access controls and digital delivery system in place on  
legitimate sales channels.  
  
7) Contact information for the complaining party:  
Name: [private]  
Address: [private]

Email: [private]  
Phone: [private]    
  
8) Good faith statement:  
I have a good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted material  
described above in the manner complained of is not authorized by me, my  
agent, or the law.  
I have taken fair use into consideration.  
  
9) Accuracy and perjury statement:  
The information in this notice is accurate, and under penalty of  
perjury, I certify that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act  
on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly  
infringed.
