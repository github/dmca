**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**  
  
Several links that your website is hosting are infringing on at least one (1) if not more copyrights(s) owned by EC-Council. The copyright content sourced from EC-Council official Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) course is being unlawfully uploaded in the form of "CEH Study Material" through your website without permission and in blatant violation of our proprietary rights. Furthermore, EC-Council is the owner and developer of the course "Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)" and owns copyright in all its versions which [private] has illegally uploaded through its GitHub Account. The customers seeking EC-Council's courses may be misled into thinking that the infringing content and courses uploaded are endorsed or affiliated with EC-Council. As a result of the misrepresentation caused by the account owner, EC-Council is likely to suffer damage in the form of loss of sales, damage to its reputation, and further risks confusing our clients. We assert that this is a clear intent of riding freely on the goodwill of EC-Council.

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright.

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**  
  
Specific files within the repository are infringing
