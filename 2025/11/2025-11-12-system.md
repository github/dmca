**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The BSD 3-Clause License requires that redistributions of the source code retain the copyright notice, the list of conditions, and the license text. The infringing repository at https://github.com/CodeAra-official/OmniOS-2.0 contains copyrighted material originally authored by [private] under the BSD 3-Clause License, and it has removed the copyright notice, removed the BSD-3 license file, and provides no attribution to [private] as the original author. This is a direct violation of the BSD 3-Clause License terms.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

To bring the project into compliance, the infringing repository must restore the BSD 3-Clause License file, retain [private] copyright notice, and provide attribution to [private] as the original author as required by the license.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

The only direct contact information I have is what is listed on their profile:
