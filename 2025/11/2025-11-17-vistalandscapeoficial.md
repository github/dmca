**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

Nature of copyright ownership:

I am the [private] of the official website https://vistalandscapeoficial.com/  
and of the original content that appears on it.  
Although the HTML/CSS template used for the site was not created by [private], [private] built the final structure of the website, organized its content, integrated [private] own materials, and published the official version on [private] domain.

The images, photographs, and visual resources used on the site are [private] own original work, created by [private] exclusively for the Vista Landscape project, and these materials appear copied in the infringing repository.

The repository “vistalandscape-dev/Vistalandscape” was originally created from an account that belonged to [private], but the associated [private] account was permanently deleted. Because of this, [private] no longer have access to the GitHub account and cannot manage or remove the repository.

As a result, the site published on GitHub Pages is causing indexing conflicts and directly affecting the visibility of [private] official website, since it appears as an active copy of [private] content without my control or authorization.

As the [private] of the original images and of the final content published under [private] official domain, and because this repository displays and distributes this material without [private] authorization, I am requesting its removal.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work consists of the content published on [private] official website:  
https://vistalandscapeoficial.com/

This includes the final structure and layout of the website that [private] created, the organization of the sections and content, and especially the original images, photographs, and visual materials that [private] produced specifically for Vista Landscape. These images and visual elements are [private] own copyrighted work and are not part of any external template.

The infringing repository contains copies of the website as it appears on [private] official domain, including [private] original images and the final arrangement of the site’s content that [private] created.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**
