I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.

The library that [private] uses was illegally breaking the open-source copyright of [private] when they distributed their software without providing source. [private] repo is merely input files for this open-source project, which they do not own the copyright for. They attempted to take down my repository in the past (July 5, 2017.)

They have done this to several other developers that did not use any of their Intellectual Property, in an effort to kill open-souce competition with "their" product, which is an illegal distribution of an open-source piece of software ([private].) I feel like this is pretty severe and blatant form of patent-trolling.

I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.

Signed,
[private]
