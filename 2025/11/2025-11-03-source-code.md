GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and rights holder of the original design, structure, content, and source files of the “[private]” web project. The project materials were shared with the user “KIS-IT-PRODUCTION” only within our team/company for development purposes, and were never published on GitHub or any other public platform. The user was not authorized to publicly distribute, share, or post any of these materials. Therefore, I am the rightful copyright owner of all materials unlawfully posted on GitHub.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The copyrighted materials include the design, content, structure, and source files of the web project “Ibedrola”. These materials were shared internally within our company/team for development purposes only, under strict confidentiality. The user “KIS-IT-PRODUCTION” publicly posted these materials on GitHub without permission, violating confidentiality and our copyright.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

The original work is not publicly available online.

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The user “KIS-IT-PRODUCTION” circumvented the access restrictions by publicly posting the project on GitHub without authorization, despite the materials being strictly internal and confidential.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project bypassed the technological protection by being publicly published on GitHub, even though the original project “Ibedrola” was stored in a private repository with access restricted only to authorized personnel.  
No one outside the project team was allowed to view or distribute the materials, but the user posted the entire repository publicly, circumventing these access controls.
