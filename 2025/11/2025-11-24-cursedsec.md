**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
I am the [private] and copyright holder of the original source code, methodologies, and technical documentation contained within these projects, created and authored by [private] a.k.a. [private]. The intellectual property is now exclusively protected and owned by CursedSec. The work is governed by the CursedSec Ownership Edict (COE), a proprietary license that dictates strict terms of use and explicitly prohibits unauthorized distribution, re-uploading, and the creation of derivative works outside of the official repository.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**  
  
The original copyrighted work is a sophisticated suite of proprietary cybersecurity, penetration testing, and analysis tools developed by CursedSec (Operated by [private]). This work is not open-source; it is a proprietary collection of technical scripts and methodologies that represent significant intellectual investment.  
  
Crucial Ethical and Compliance Rationale (Risk of Misuse):  
- The original CursedSec repositories contain explicit, mandatory disclaimers requiring the Software to be used solely for authorized, ethical cybersecurity assessments. By downloading the code from the original source, the user agrees to these terms and the ethical constraints imposed.  
- The infringing repositories bypass this critical control. When the code is downloaded from an unauthorized source, the end-user is no longer bound by the original disclaimers and legal terms present in the CursedSec repository (now protected by the COE). This lack of immediate ethical constraint enables the illicit use of CursedSec's proprietary penetration testing tools for unauthorized, malicious attacks against third parties.  
- GitHub's failure to remove these copies directly facilitates the potential misuse of sophisticated security tools for illegal activities. Removing the infringing content is essential to ensure that anyone using this software is properly directed to the official CursedSec repository, where they are bound by the strict ethical disclaimers and the CursedSec Ownership Edict (COE), thereby protecting GitHub from downstream liability related to software misuse.
