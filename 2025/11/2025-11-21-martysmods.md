Note: Because the reported network that contained the allegedly infringing content was larger than one hundred (100) repositories, and the submitter alleged that all or most of the forks were infringing to the same extent as the parent repository, GitHub processed the takedown notice against the entire network of 162 repositories, inclusive of the parent repository.

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**  
  
**Based on the above, I confirm that:**  
  
Specific files within the repository are infringing  
  
**Identify only the specific file URLs within the repository that is infringing:**  
  
The upstream repository ([invalid]) has already removed all copyrighted material and does not contain infringing content. Only the listed forks contain unauthorized copies and should be removed.
