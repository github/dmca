**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
I am the [private] and copyright holder of the project "OpenLauncher", originally published under the GNU General Public License v2 (GPLv2). I am acting as the [private] and [private] of the source code and associated design assets.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**  
  
The original copyrighted work is the project "OpenLauncher", a Python (PyQt5) desktop application that implements Microsoft authentication, mod management, and Minecraft version handling. The source code was published under the GNU GPLv2 license on [private] official repository:  
  
https://github.com/CesarGarza55/OpenLauncher  
  
**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**  
  
https://github.com/CesarGarza55/OpenLauncher  
  
**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**  
  
**Based on the above, I confirm that:**  
  
The entire repository is infringing  
  
**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**  
  
https://github.com/Pernoise/Rocketmc  
  
**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**  
  
No  
  
**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**  
  
**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**  
  
Yes  
  
**Which license?**  
  
gnu-general-public-license-v2.0  
  
**How do you believe the license is being violated?**  
  
The repository at https://github.com/Pernoise/Rocketmc is a fork of [private] project (OpenLauncher).  
The infringing repository still includes [private] original LICENSE file (GNU GPLv2), but the author modified the README to claim the project is under the MIT license.  
This creates a misleading and unauthorized relicensing of [private] work.  
  
**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**  
  
The project can be brought into compliance by restoring the correct license reference.  
Specifically, the README must be updated to clearly state that the project is licensed under GNU GPLv2, not the MIT license.  
Attribution to the original project (OpenLauncher by CesarGarza55) must also be preserved.  
  
**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**  
  
The alleged infringer’s GitHub profile is available at https://github.com/Pernoise.  
Their public email was contacted, but no response was received.  
No additional contact information is available.  
  
**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**  
  
**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**  
  
**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**  
  
**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
