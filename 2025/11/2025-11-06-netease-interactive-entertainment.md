Dear GitHub Copyright Agent,

I am writing on behalf of NetEase Interactive Entertainment Pte. Ltd., to submit a formal DMCA takedown notice regarding repositories (as listed below) that are specifically designed to circumvent the technological protection measures we have implemented to safeguard our assets in the game Destiny: Rising, including in particular the NetEase games engine [private].

1. Identification of Copyrighted Work

The game title Destiny: Rising is owned by NetEase Interactive Entertainment Pte. Ltd, the business license of which is attached in this email. The game is available at https://apps.apple.com/us/app/destiny-rising/id1593326563 . You may visit our official website at: https://www.playdestinyrising.com/index.html 

2. Identification of Infringing Material

The following repository(ies) and/or content unlawfully distribute circumvention tools/instructions that facilitate unauthorized access to our copyrighted software:

i. [private]

Although the description of this repository does not specify its purpose and targeted software, the code inside the file “crates” specifically mentions the target to be our game, Destiny: Rising and our game build, [private], as shown in the above picture. 

ii. https://github.com/nblockbuster/dr-messiah

The description of this repository specifically targets our game title Destiny: Rising and our game engine [private].

3. Circumvention of our Technological Measures

1)     Describe any technological measures you have in place, and how they effectively control access to your copyrighted material.

Our game resources (including but not limited to textures, audio files, and configuration files) are protected by the following technological measures to prevent unauthorized access and distribution: 
 
i. Encryption of Game Assets: 

We use a encryption algorithm to encrypt all package files. The encrypted assets cannot be read or modified without the decryption key and algorithm.

The decryption process is only triggered during runtime by the legitimate game client, ensuring that assets remain protected in storage and our game assets will not be accessed without authorization.

ii. Code Obfuscation: 

The decryption functions are implemented in a native library (SO file) on Android, further protected by certain obfuscation methods, which make it more difficult to reverse-engineer the decryption logic.
 
2) Describe how the accused project is designed to circumvent your previously described technological protection measures.

The accused project has publicly disclosed decryption algorithm which contains our proprietary encryption key, enabling unauthorized public access to our copyrighted game assets. While we cannot confirm the specific cracking methods employed by the infringing party, the following facts are evident:

i. The project obtained our encrypted game assets and decompiled the obfuscated SO library to extract the decryption algorithm.

ii. The project published the decryption algorithm on GitHub, enabling third parties to decrypt our protected assets without authorization. This allows users to access and misuse our game resources (such as game maps, audio files, etc.) without running the legitimate client.

Such conduct falls squarely within the prohibitions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Under 17 U.S.C. §106, copyright owners hold the exclusive rights to reproduce and distribute their works. The repositories in question enable unauthorized reproduction of our protected assets. Furthermore, under 17 U.S.C. §1201, it is unlawful to circumvent technological protection measures that control access to copyrighted works, and equally unlawful to provide tools that facilitate such circumvention. By breaking our encryption and publishing the circumvention methods, the repositories have engaged in unlawful conduct under the DMCA.

4. Action Requested

Pursuant to 17 U.S.C. §512(c)(3), service providers must “expeditiously remove or disable access” to material claimed to be infringing upon receiving proper notification. We therefore request that GitHub immediately remove or disable access to the infringing repositories identified at the foregoing URL(s).

We also request that you preserve relevant evidence, including repository commit history, contributor information, and access logs, for potential legal proceedings. Please confirm in writing within 48 hours of receipt of this notice and the actions taken to comply with these requests.

5. Statements

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.
