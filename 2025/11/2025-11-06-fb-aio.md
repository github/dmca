**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] [private] and copyright holder of the software.  
[private] developed the source code [private] and I did not grant permission for redistribution, modification, or publication of the software in any form.   
Therefore, I am authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner, which is [private].

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The copyrighted work is a software project named "FB AIO".  
It is a browser extension / web application developed by [private], containing source code, logic, UI components, and build output processed using Vite and light obfuscation.  
The infringing repository has distributed [private] software without permission and in a modified/cracked state, which violates [private] copyright and [private] licensing terms.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

extension source code: [private]  
extension webstore: [private]  
webpage: [private]

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/firetofficial/fb-aio-crack

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

[private] software uses technological protection measures (biện pháp bảo vệ kỹ thuật - technological protection measures) including:

• 🧱 Code bundling and module packaging (đóng gói module)  
• 🔐 Light code obfuscation (làm rối mã nhẹ - obfuscation) to prevent reverse-engineering  
• 📦 Hash-based integrity checks (kiểm tra toàn vẹn dựa trên hash)  
• 🔑 License key validation (xác thực bản quyền) tied to user environment

These measures effectively restrict unauthorized modification, redistribution, or extraction of functional components of the software. They are intended to ensure that only legitimate users can access the software in its original, safe form.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project intentionally bypasses and removes these technological protection measures. The infringing code:

• 🪓 Removes or disables license key validation (vượt xác thực bản quyền - license validation bypass)  
• 🧩 Deobfuscates and re-bundles the code to expose internal logic (gỡ rối - deobfuscation)  
• 🛠️ Distributes modified builds of my software without authorization  
• 🚫 Strips or replaces my code integrity checks (loại bỏ kiểm tra toàn vẹn)

These actions constitute circumvention (vượt biện pháp bảo vệ - circumvention) under DMCA §1201 because they directly defeat the technical measures [private] implemented to control access and prevent unauthorized distribution.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

https://github.com/lytrieu002/fb-aio-crack  
https://github.com/manhgdev/fb-aio-crack  
https://github.com/ngovanhuyhoang/fb-aio-crack   
https://github.com/tqa24/fb-aio-crack  
https://github.com/zenjichen/fb-aio-crack

**Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
