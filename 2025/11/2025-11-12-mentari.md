**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and copyright holder of the project titled "Mentari-UNPAM", which was published on [private] GitHub account (github.com/Lukman754/Mentari-Unpam).  
This project, including its structure, code, and documentation, was entirely developed by [private].  
I have not authorized any person to redistribute, modify, or publish [private] work elsewhere.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original project is an educational extension named Mentari, designed for [private], which includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and manifest files specifically structured for a browser extension.  
The infringing repository copied [private] entire source code and structure, renamed the project using the same name “Mentari-UNPAM”, and removed [private] name entirely from all files, replacing it with the name “B-Test3301”.

The MIT License [private] used requires that [private] copyright notice remains intact, but the infringer replaced it with:

"Copyright (c) 2025 B-Test3301"

This constitutes a clear license violation and false authorship claim.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

https://github.com/lukman754/Mentari-Unpam

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

mit-license

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The infringer removed [private] name from the LICENSE file, replaced it with their own (“B-Test3301”), and distributed the work publicly as their own creation.  
This directly violates the MIT License’s requirement to retain the original copyright notice in all copies and substantial portions of the Software.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

To comply with the MIT License, the infringing repository must:

- Restore [private] full copyright attribution (“Copyright (c) 2025 [private]”).  
- Remove all false author names.  
- Or make the repository private or delete it entirely if attribution cannot be restored.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

GitHub username: B-Test3301  
Profile URL: https://github.com/B-Test3301
