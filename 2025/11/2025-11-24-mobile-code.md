**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of the source code for my mobile application. The freelancer who uploaded the code to GitHub was given access only for evaluation purposes and did not have permission to publish, copy, or distribute it. I hold all rights to this code and am fully authorized to request its removal.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work is the complete source code of my private mobile application project, including all React Native code, configuration files, Firebase settings, GoogleService-Info.plist, project structure, and related proprietary assets. This code was created for my application and was never intended to be publicly distributed or published. The freelancer posted this private source code on a public GitHub repository without my permission.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

The original copyrighted work is not available online. It is a private project stored only in my local development environment and private repositories.

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

It was not authorized for public distribution or upload. The freelancer bypassed these access restrictions by publishing the code on GitHub without permission

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The freelancer bypassed my access restrictions by taking code that was shared with him privately for evaluation and uploading it to a public GitHub repository without permission. By publishing the code publicly, he circumvented the technological protection measures that limited access to my private project
