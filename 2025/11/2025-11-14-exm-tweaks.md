**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

EXM Premium Tweaking Utility is protected by advanced code obfuscation and a license verification system.  
Each build requires a valid license key and connects to our secure server for verification before activation.  
These measures prevent unauthorized copying, modification, or redistribution of the software by ensuring only verified users can access the program in full functionality.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The infringing repositories contain cracked or modified versions of EXM Premium Tweaking Utility in which the license verification system and obfuscation layers were removed.  
These modifications allow users to run and redistribute the program without going through our server-based authentication, directly bypassing our technological protection measures.
