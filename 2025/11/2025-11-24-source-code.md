**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] [private] and copyright owner of the original source code.
This code was developed entirely by [private] and was never published under any
open source license. I have exclusive rights to its distribution and
reproduction under U.S. and international copyright law.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The infringed work is a proprietary NodeJS server application [private] developed
privately for a private game server environment. The original codebase,
internally named "[private]," contains NodeJS code.

The repository was created as a private [private] project and has never been
published under any open source license, shared publicly, or intended for
public distribution. Access was strictly controlled through [private]
[private] permissions.

Evidence of direct copying is demonstrable through multiple verifiable
inconsistencies in the infringing repository:

1. **Nominal Discrepancy**: The infringing repository is named "ThatLAServer,"
yet the core index.js file contains the original, unmodified server name
"[private]" string literals, proving direct code
duplication. Original: [private] vs. Infringing:
[private]

2. **Minimal Modifications**: A diff comparison reveals that beyond superficial
changes to routes/account.js and minor cosmetic alterations, the codebase
structure, file organization, and the vast majority of implementation
details remain identical to [private] private original.

3. **Structural Identity**: The repository architecture, dependency structure,
and core server logic match [private] private codebase exactly, as documented in
comparative screenshots: Original Repo Structure [private]
vs. Infringing Repo Structure [private].

This work was never intended for open source release. Its unauthorized
publication as "ThatLAServer" directly undermines the proprietary nature of
the private gaming ecosystem it supports and may cause financial harm to the
game publisher. I request immediate takedown to prevent further unauthorized
distribution.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

Private [private] [private]: [private]

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

**TPM in place:** [private] private repository access controls, which require:  
- User authentication via username/password and 2FA  
- Explicit collaborator invitations and permission management  
- SSH key or token-based access authorization

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The infringer gained access to [private] private [private] through "a former collaborator whose access was not properly revoked"

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
