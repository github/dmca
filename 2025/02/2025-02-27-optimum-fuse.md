**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The copyrighted work in question is [private] Modrinth modpack OptimumFuse. While the author hasn't used any specific configurations, they've clearly based the mod-sheet, which is the most integral part of a modpack, on [private] project. During their 1.0.0 version, the project did credit [private] project, however, the author claims that their rebranded 2.0.0 version is not even slightly based on mine. It clearly is still based on [private] modpack's mod-sheet, with a few mods removed, which they thought made their project completely different from mine.

The mod-sheet being infringed upon: https://github.com/UltimatChamp/optimum-fuse/blob/main/modrinth/fabric/1.21.4/modrinth.index.json

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The following file is infringing upon, and should be taken down:

https://github.com/mptamilan/xtremely-optimized/blob/main/modrinth/fabric/1.21.4/modrinth.index.json
