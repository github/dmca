**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of Khantech/Loranlord. The code published at the infringing repository was developed under our company and is wholly owned by Loranlord. The developer in question ([private]) was terminated and has no legal right to share or reuse this code. He has re-uploaded it in violation of a previous request and has threatened to publish more as retaliation for a rejected invoice.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The content includes the proprietary frontend and backend source code of the Vatan iGaming platform, including application logic, internal architecture, and configuration. This code is company property and contains sensitive intellectual property. It was initially removed after a prior DMCA, and has now been maliciously re-uploaded.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

The original work was stored in private [private] under the [private] organization and is not publicly available online.

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content?

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The original code was hosted in private [private] owned by Khantech, accessible only to authorized developers. Access was protected using [private] organization-level permissions, two-factor authentication (2FA), private repo restrictions, and internal version control policies. The code was never made public, and all contributors were under confidentiality and IP assignment agreements

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The individual gained temporary access during onboarding. After termination and removal from our systems, he used local copies of the code to upload it to a public GitHub repository. This act directly bypassed our access control, violated IP and confidentiality terms, and was done deliberately as retaliation for a denied payment. It is a repeat infringement after prior takedown and legal warning.
