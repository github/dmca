Employee of copyright owner, Nintendo of America Inc.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The Nintendo Switch console and video games contain technological protection measures (“TPMs”) that permit the Nintendo Switch console to interact only with legitimate Nintendo video game files. This process protects Nintendo’s copyright-protected video games, including but not limited to those covered by U.S. Copyright Registration numbers PA0002213509 (Super Mario Maker 2); PA0002233840 (Animal Crossing: New Horizons); PA0002213908 (Luigi’s Mansion 3); and PA0002028142 (The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild) by preventing users from playing pirated copies of Nintendo’s video games on the Nintendo Switch console and by preventing users from unlawfully copying and playing Nintendo’s video games on unauthorized devices.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing: **

https://github.com/Ryubing/Stable-Releases  
[invalid]  

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Nintendo embeds TPMs in both the Nintendo Switch console and video game files, including but not limited to encryption of the video game files. Certain cryptographic keys, such as prod.keys, are required to verify, access, and play each game played on the Nintendo Switch. The TPMs employ encryption as described in more detail below.
The Nintendo Switch console allows users either to play games on physical cartridges that are inserted into the console or to play games digitally downloaded from Nintendo’s server. Both formats are protected by Nintendo’s TPMs, including encryption of its video games. When a game is started on the Nintendo Switch console the games are decrypted and verified using various Nintendo cryptographic keys so they may be played. Nintendo owns or exclusively controls numerous copyrights in software and games that are protected from unlawful access and copying by the operation of these TPMs. In their ordinary course of operation, the TPMs require the application of information and a process (as described above), with the authority of Nintendo, to gain access to Nintendo’s copyrighted works, and thus effectively control access to and copying of Nintendo’s copyrighted works.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The reported repositories offer, link, or otherwise provide access to the Ryujinx emulator or code based on the Ryujinx emulator. The Ryujinx emulator is primarily designed to play Nintendo Switch games. Specifically, Ryujinx illegally circumvents Nintendo’s TPMs and runs illegal copies of Nintendo Switch games. Nintendo Switch games are encrypted using proprietary cryptographic keys (prod.keys) which protect against unauthorized access to and copying of the copyrighted games. During operation, Ryujinx necessarily uses unauthorized copies of these cryptographic keys to decrypt unauthorized copies of Nintendo Switch games, or ROMs, at or immediately before runtime without Nintendo’s authorization. Thus, Ryujinx is primarily designed to and unlawfully “circumvent[s] a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under” the DMCA and distribution of Ryujinx constitutes unlawful trafficking in technology that is “primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access” to copyrighted works. 17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(1) and (2). See also Final Judgment & Permanent Injunction, Nintendo of America Inc. v. Tropic Haze LLC, No. 1:24-cv-00082 (D.R.I. Mar. 6, 2024), ECF No. 11 (finding that the distribution of software which primarily decrypts Nintendo Switch games without authorization violated DMCA anti-trafficking provisions).
