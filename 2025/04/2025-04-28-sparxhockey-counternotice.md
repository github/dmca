The author of the DMCA takedown notice made several mistakes. This is [private] reply:

„Our Terms of Service govern the use of our products. https://sparxhockey.com/pages/terms-of-service“  
- Mistake 1: The URL stated (https://sparxhockey.com/pages/terms-of-service) was in [private] at the time of the purchase of the Sparx grinding machine and Sparx grinding rings, and further up until March 11, 2025, not reachable. Since March 11, 2025 is the stated URL successfully redirected to the Sparx „UK/EU/EEA Terms & Conditions of Sale, valid as of September 2, 2022“ (https://sparxhockey.eu/pages/terms-of-service).

„Under the Sparx Hockey Terms of Service, users expressly agree not to: disable, circumvent, or otherwise avoid or undermine any security device, mechanism, protocol, or procedure implemented in the Service.“  
- Mistake 2: The „UK/EU/EEA Terms & Conditions of Sale, valid as of September 2, 2022“ (https://sparxhockey.eu/pages/terms-of-service) do not contain the phrase: „disable, circumvent, or otherwise avoid or undermine any security device, mechanism, protocol, or procedure implemented in the Service“. Therefore it is impossible for users to „expressly agree“ to this conditions.  
- Mistake 3: The artificial limitation of the lifespan of Sparx grinding rings by [private]. is a breach of [private] consumer protection laws and in violation of the legislation against planned obsolescence and the right to repair by the user. Such provisions would therefore also be legally void in the Terms of Service of the Sparx ecosystem.

„GitHub user providing unauthorized access tools and instructions to access DMCA covered software code that authenticates products.“  
- Mistake 4: The ReSharper repository contains only documentation, but no tools, no source code and no binaries.  
- Mistake 5: The documentation in the ReSharper repository was completely written by [private] with the help of some contributors and the public documentation of the chip manufacturer [private] for the [private] tag. No copyrighted material from [private] was used.  
- Mistake 6: The instructions in the documentation do not give any access to „DMCA covered software code“.

„These tools enable users to unlock and provide unauthorized access which compromises safety and security of users.“  
- Mistake 7: It is the obligation of [private]. to market a product that complies to all regulations and safety standards. This does not give [private]. the right to define what the owners of the product are allowed to do with the product, nor the right to generally prevent the owners from modifying the product, even if these actions, which I strongly doubt in the case of the documentation in the ReSharper repository, „compromises safety and security of“ the owners.

„The GitHub user [private] is explaining on your website how to sniff encrypted security passwords and alter them“  
- Mistake 8: The used [private] tag does not support encrypted security passwords. Only plain text passwords are supported.  
- Mistake 9: Only the newest Sparx grinding rings are using plain text passwords. The original Sparx grinding rings do not use any passwords at all.  
- Mistake 10: The documentation in the ReSharper repository does not contain any information about how to alter the plain text passwords of the rings.

„to access and operate our products in a manner inconsistent with our Terms of Service.“  
- Mistake 11: The Sparx „UK/EU/EEA Terms & Conditions of Sale, valid as of September 2, 2022“ does not contain any limit, how to access and operate the Sparx grinding machine.

„This user also supplies layouts of encrypted data stored on our product.“  
- Mistake 12: The used [private] tag does not support encrypted data storage. Only plain text storage protected by a plain text password is supported.
- Mistake 13: Only the newest Sparx grinding rings are using plain text passwords. The original Sparx grinding rings do not use any passwords at all. The layout of the data has not changed between the original and the new Sparx grinding rings.
