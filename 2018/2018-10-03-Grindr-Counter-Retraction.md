Dear Github DMCA Agent,

I wish to retract my DMCA counter notice concerning my repository tomlandia/fuckr. While I don’t believe my code infringes Grindr LLC’s copyright in any way, I am no longer willing to face legal action in a foreign court simply to keep this project hosted on Github.

Thank you,
