Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

The material that was removed does not apply under the DMCA. The material that was contained in the repository was written by me, [private], for the purpose of submitting solutions to an online contest.  
After reviewing the DMCA, Codesignal (the company who issued the DMCA), has no claim over my solutions to their puzzles. While they do have claim to the puzzles themselves, my solutions to them are owned by me. I believe the original DMCA request for this repository was an abusive takedown request that has no validity in this situation.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**

**Please confirm that you have you have read our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Counter Notice</a>.**
