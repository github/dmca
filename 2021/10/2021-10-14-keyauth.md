**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and [private] of https://keyauth.com. [private] authored the code the repository uploader stole from [private] software.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

[private] code from https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CSHARP-Example and https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-Python-Example has been stolen. If you compare https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-Python-Example/blob/main/keyauth.py and https://github.com/AuthGuard-NET/Python/blob/main/authguard.py or https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CSHARP-Example/blob/main/ConsoleExample/KeyAuth.cs and https://github.com/AuthGuard-NET/CSharp/blob/main/Console%20Example/API.cs, you should be able to easily notice the blatant stolen code. This code is only licensed to be used by [private] customers contacting [private] API, and surely isn't licensed to a competitor to steal [private] code.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/AuthGuard-NET/CSharp

https://github.com/AuthGuard-NET/Python

Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No forks.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

[private] on Discord. [private] was banned from his server/group upon joining it. Clearly he doesn't want to talk to [private] letalone remove the repositories where he stole [private] code.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
