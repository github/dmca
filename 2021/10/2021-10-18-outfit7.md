The request for removal of a public GitHub repository which consists exclusively of Outfit7's intellectual property (copyrighted materials) has been submitted on behalf of Outfit7 Limited, the copyright owner of the work described below.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Through a routine check we identified a repository on Github, which infringes the copyright of Outfit7 Limited. The identified repository appears to include a direct or literal copy of Outfit7's confidential and proprietary source code, which is incorporated in several Outfit7's Unity based game applications and is not publicly available. Several files in the identified repository also bear copyright notices of Outfit7, attesting to the proprietary status of the materials. As the content was uploaded to GitHub without authorization from the copyright holder, we seek its complete removal.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

We seek removal of the entire repository “Outfit7” at https://github.com/M-XY/MX/tree/master/Assets/Code/Outfit7
