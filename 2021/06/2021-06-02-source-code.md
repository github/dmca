I [private] this piece of code back in 2020 for [private], and another person purchased a license to it.  
- After a while, someone else got the code, and then leaked it on github.  
I etc have the original code and a youtube video of me showcasing the script, long before it's even published on his github.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The code is not under open source license

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

I would like to have it completely removed, I see that he has leaked others work aswell, and should be punished somehow.
