**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I own the source code this guy published for the program called "HumanMasterPlugin".
It's referring to this software: https://wrobot.eu/files/file/1486-paid-humanmasterplugin/

In the repository, it can clearly be seen that he does not own the code. He decompiled it (thankfully an old version) and is very openly stating that it belongs to me. He is also trying to dox me in that very repository.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

https://wrobot.eu/files/file/1486-paid-humanmasterplugin/  
I can also prove that I'm the original owner of the source code. However, it is not hosted on GitHub, but on a private bitbucket repository.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/TheSmokie/HumanMasterPlugin-Wrobot-

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I have not found any forks

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

It is not released under any open source license and the source code was never officially available. He decompiled the binary.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Removal only

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
