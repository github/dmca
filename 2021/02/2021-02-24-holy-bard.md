**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am an artist/illustrator, and designed and painted the pieces of artwork that are the subject of this DMCA notice. They are copyrighted solely to me, and I forbid the use of my artwork in any way without my permission.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

My copyrighted artwork that is being infringed features characters I made for myself and a party member for a tabletop campaign we participated in back in 2017. They are very personal to me, and I spent several hours crafting both specifically for our campaign.

Example links to my artwork on social media are below:

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes. To my knowledge I have found the current forks that employ my artwork in their image files.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No. My artwork is never licensed under open source.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The best solution would be that my artwork is removed/deleted from the repositories. The pieces I painted of my characters were cropped and used without my consent, and thus violate my copyright. Even if the repositories were made private, I would want my artwork removed from them.

Dozens of other artists' illustrations are also used in the repositories. The users should ask for permissions and licenses for every character image they use prior to upload.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**
