This link is not active at the moment after we‘ve asked the user mdrenger by e-mail to take it down. A detailed comparison of the data availabale under this link and the oroginal HK-DE has proven, that the data available via GitHub corresponds to the HK-DE. In particular (but not only), the data includes objects, which are included in the HK-DE as "dummy-objects". These objects are fake objects, in order to detect unauthorized uses of the HK-DE.
It is possible, that the user [private] will re-activate the link. Therefore the link should be deleted irreversible. Currently we are also about to take legal action against the user [private].
