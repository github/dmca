Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

BP Mobile LLC owns all exclusive rights to QAToolkit (QAT).  
QAT is a proprietary software kit which was developed for internal use and not designed for distribution of any kind.  
It has come to our attention that in 2018 QAT was placed on GitHub by user <fvonk>: https://github.com/fvonk/qat  
As the GitHub repository is synchronized with our corporate storage, all updates that have been made on our side automatically became available to public - they are dispalyed on 
GitHub as commited by our developers.  
Thus we claim that QAT was accessed and distributed without authorization of the rightholder. 

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

QAToolKit is a tool that simplifies monitoring of an iOS application - it tracks incoming and outgoing traffic, the state of memory and CPU, the file system of the application, 
shows the purchases, allows to add custom actions, display the values of various variables, etc. The tool is embedded in the debug assembly of the application. It simplifies and 
speeds up some of the tasks related to the localization of the steps to reproduce bugs.  
QAT is a propriatary software kit, it has never been posted online by BP Mobile. It is an inhouse study and has certain commercial value.  

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

We also ask to suspend the infringing account: https://github.com/fvonk  

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

This is the only fork that was detected: https://github.com/asfed/QAToolkit

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

QAT is a result of custom development, all rights belong to BP Mobile LLC.  
No license was issued by the rightholder to distribute QAT as open source software.  

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

We ask for removal, no other options are admissible for us in case of infringement of this kind.
