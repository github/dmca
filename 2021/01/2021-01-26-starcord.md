**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Entire respository, https://github.com/cha0t1kpaster/StarCord-Old-Loader.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

There are no forks this is an unauthorized leak not a legitimate source code.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**
