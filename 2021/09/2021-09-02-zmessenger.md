**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the person who wrote the source code. The commits specify my account name, and link to my emails.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

URL: https://github.com/zmessenger-dev/zmessenger

A few years ago, I decided to create a desktop client for a website. After working on it for a while, I squashed my work and pushed it upstream. I lost interest soon after, and proceeded to forget about it.

I recently took an interest in working on it again, so I checked out the source. The single squished commit has my primary account as the committer. I absolutely do not want this activity linked to my main account. I'm filing this DMCA because I have no means of logging into the alt account or taking the content down myself.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Everything in https://github.com/zmessenger-dev/zmessenger

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

The project does not have any forks listed, and I doubt anyone has a private copy of the code since I never advertised it.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The work does not mention any license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Destroy the repository.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

The infringer is my alt account.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
