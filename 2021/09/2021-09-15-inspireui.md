Looks like there are no forks

We are selling the full mobile app project that the team has spent more than 1 year to develop, these repositories are not the small species of code or module, they are sharing the whole source code as public and other users could download the reuse it. 
Then you can see how much damage if our sales is impacted by these sharing source code.
