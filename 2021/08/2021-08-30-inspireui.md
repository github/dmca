**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Looks like there are no forks

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

These products are selling on the Envato marketplace, and protected under Envato License https://codecanyon.net/licenses/standard?license=regular  
This license is NOT an open-source project to be shared on Github.

We are selling the full mobile app project that the team has spent more than 1 year to develop, these repositories are not the small species of code or module, they are sharing the whole source code as public and other users could download the reuse it.  
Then you can see how much damage if our sales is impacted by these sharing source code.

Please help to remove these repos.
