To Whom it May Concern:

I am the [private] at SiteCompli (http://sitecompli.com). This DMCA Notice is being filed in tandem with a filing from our vendor, Icreon (http://www.icreon.com/). 

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. 

We have discovered that a former employee (user rishiphp0312) of our offshore vendor has uploaded the source of one of our products to his GitHub account. The source in question can be found at https://github.com/rishiphp0312/sitebuildemailnyc/.

It is clear via the directory structure and contents of the files (example: https://github.com/rishiphp0312/sitebuildemailnyc/blob/master/Sitecomplidatabasestructure-8-may.sql) that this code is a direct copy of a core product we sell and support for close to 1,000 clients in the NYC Commercial Real Estate sector.

It is a direct, literal copy of our work, albeit several versions old. Regardless, it contains content that has been unchanged and poses a direct intellectual property and security risk to our business.

The current, legitimate copy of our codebase is current hosted on a different git provider, but I have commited a temporary copy to our private company repository on GitHub. The location of our copy is hosted at [private].

User rishiphp0312 must immediately delete the entire repository located at https://github.com/rishiphp0312/sitebuildemailnyc/ and any local copies of the identified code.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
