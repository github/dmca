Dear github.com,

We are writing this letter on behalf of SAE International.

We have received information leading us to believe that the website located at http://www.github.com (the "Website") is hosting and/or facilitating the downloading and/or streaming of content (listed below) in which SAE International is the copyright owner and/or the owner of exclusive rights in such content (the "SAE International Properties"). No one is authorized to exhibit, reproduce, transmit, or otherwise distribute SAE International Properties without the express written permission of SAE International, and the unauthorized distribution of SAE International Properties constitutes copyright infringement. This conduct may also violate the laws of other countries, international law, and/or treaty obligations.

1. Identification of copyrighted work(s):  
NETWORK MANAGEMENT - J1939/81

2. Copyright infringing material or activity found at the following location(s):

http://github.com/zhuhaijun753/J1939-proto-stack/blob/master/SAE_J1939-81.pdf

We have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the Website is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

Accordingly, SAE International requests that http://www.github.com immediately cease access to the SAE International Properties in connection with the Website, and further requests that http://www.github.com confirms in writing to the undersigned that (i) access to the SAE International Properties has been removed and that (ii) appropriate actions have been taken against the account holder under your Abuse Policy/Terms of Service Agreement.

The information in this notice is accurate and we state, under penalty of perjury, that we are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

This letter is not a complete statement of SAE International's rights in connection with this matter, and nothing contained herein constitutes an express or implied waiver of any rights or remedies of SAE International in connection with this matter, all of which are expressly reserved.

We appreciate your assistance and thank you for your cooperation in this matter.
