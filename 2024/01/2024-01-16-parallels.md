**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I [private], [private] at Parallels , have the been assigned the task of issuing DMCA takedown requests on behalf of Parallels.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The repositories that will be listed later are intended to bypass the license validation code for Parallels Desktop 19 for Mac. The Software can be found at https://www.parallels.com/ca/products/desktop/ and https://www.parallels.com/ca/products/desktop/pro/

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository located at https://github.com/alsyundawy/Parallels and all of it's forks provide instructions and code that serve no legitimate purpose other than bypassing both license and integrity verification of Parallels copyrighted products.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

We use code signing, as provided by Apple, internal verification, encrypted license keys, and recurrent validation by our license servers. These are all bypassed using a combination of dynamic library hooking and network settings

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The project describes how to add a library and resign the application package, the added library hooks our validation and integrity checking methods. An included script adds our license servers to the hosts.deny file.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

"Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository."
