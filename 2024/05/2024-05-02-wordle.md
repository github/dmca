**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

We represent The New York Times Company (“The Times”), the owner of the famous and widely known WORDLE game. I am authorized to submit this Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) takedown notice regarding copyright infringement on a GitHub hosted website. The GitHub hosted website https://newyorktimesworlde.com/ displays content that infringes on our client’s intellectual property including copyright and trademark, as detailed herein.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

By way of background, On January 24, 2022, The Times purchased the popular word game “Wordle” (and all associated intellectual property rights with the game) from the [private] [private], including but not limited to the common-law trademark rights to the “Wordle” trademark, the copyright in the game, and the trade dress associated with the game. The Times’s acquisition of the game was widely reported in widely available news sources. The Times owns numerous trademark registrations for “Wordle” in connection with, among other things, word games and spelling and word puzzles, including U.S. Reg. No. 7,140,643; U.K. Trademark Reg. Nos. 3,749,710 and 3,753,162; European Community Trademark Reg. No. 18651261; and pending U.S. applications, 97/248,806 and 97/510,050. A link to The Times official Wordle game can be seen here: https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html. .

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The following GitHub-hosted website contains The Times’ copyrighted content: https://newyorktimesworlde.com/. In particular, the website contains a knock off of the same copyrighted Wordle puzzle owned by The Times. The layout and color scheme (gray, yellow, and green tiles) are identical to The Times’s “Wordle” game. The infringing website also uses The Times’s “Wordle” trademark without authorization. Clearly, this is a blatant attempt to trade off The Times’s well-known “Wordle” brand and confuse consumers into believing they are playing a legitimate religious version of the Wordle game, when they are not. As the infringing website’s host and now having knowledge of the infringement, you may be found liable for contributory infringement. We therefore demand the infringing website be removed immediately.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No
