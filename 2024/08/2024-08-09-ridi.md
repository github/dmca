**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

RIDI Corporation implements technological measures to control access to content through DRM. These measures allow users to access content by verifying their book ownership. Downloading original files by arbitrarily disabling DRM is prohibited.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The Reported program circumvents our DRM measures and allows users to download original content files. This program undermines our DRM protection and is being used for copyright infringement. We kindly request that you remove this program immediately.

Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes. We provide all URL in this report.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
