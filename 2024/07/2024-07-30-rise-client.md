Rise Client is a modification for the virtual sandbox game Minecraft which costs 30 US Dollars. It helps enhance the visual experience of the game. It is a paid closed source software. The license copies to our software is only sold on: https://riseclient.com/ and https://vantage.rip/ and anybody else who is not authorized by us is not legitimate and is illegally reselling our product, which is also against our terms of service.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

[invalid]

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

We have a HWID (Hardware ID) based authentication system set in place for users trying to access the software. The HWID is a unique identification generated for each user who has purchased our software from us, without infringing any of our intellectual rights. These ID's are stored in our database, which is fetched whenever a user is trying to login.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The repositories listed above have obtained the source code illegally (via social engineering methods) and removed the authentication systems from the actual software and have published it.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**
