**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

AppSealing employs a variety of advanced technological measures to protect and control access to our copyrighted material. These measures include:  
1. Root and Jailbreak Detection : An AppSealing Potected application will be not allowed to run in root or jailbroken enviroment as it has super user level of access

2. Protection Tampereing and Repackaging of Mobile Application both Android and iOS : An AppSealing Potected application will be Tamper and Repackaing proof where attackers or malicious user will not be able to tamper the application code and perform repackaging for bypassing premium subscriptions to generate modded or modified applications. Our technology adds multiple layers of security to prevent decompiling and analysis of the app’s code. This includes techniques such as code encryption and integrity checks to ensure that the app remains secure and unaltered.

3. Maclious Package based detections to identify if there is any malicious application running with in the mobile device environment where the AppSealing Protected apps are deployed or installed.

4. Code Encryption: This technique makes the app's code difficult to understand and reverse engineer. By transforming the original code into an encrypted version, it becomes nearly impossible for unauthorized parties to comprehend or manipulate the code.

5.Real time-Runtime Protection: AppSealing includes real-time monitoring and protection mechanisms that detect and prevent tampering or debugging attempts while the app is running. This ensures that any unauthorized modification or analysis is immediately thwarted.

So once the AppSealing protected application is installed the pirates/hackers/malicious user has to bypass the mentioned above controls to compromise the target application and the highlighted Github repositories describes users how to disable our above security mechanisms, exposing millions of apps protected by our solution to risks like data breaches, financial fraud, cheating, and unauthorized content distribution.

Scenario Example  
Consider a banking app protected by AppSealing. This app handles sensitive financial transactions and stores personal information of users. If a malicious actor uses the tools and methods provided in the repository at [private] to bypass AppSealing's protections, they can:

Access Sensitive Data: By reverse engineering the app, the attacker could gain access to encrypted data, such as user passwords and bank account details.  
Manipulate Transactions: The attacker could alter the app's code to perform unauthorized transactions, transferring money from user accounts without their knowledge.  
Bypass Security Checks: Real-time protection and integrity checks could be disabled, allowing the attacker to modify the app’s behavior without detection.  
This compromise not only results in financial loss for users but also damages the bank’s reputation and trust. By using AppSealing’s security measures, such threats are mitigated, ensuring that the banking app remains secure and trustworthy.

By providing these tools and methods, the repositories compromise the security and integrity of applications protected by AppSealing, causing potential harm to users and developers relying on our technology for protection.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused projects, available at [private] and https://github.com/LEAGUE-OF-NINE/AppPealing are specifically designed to bypass AppSealing’s advanced security measures. It does this by providing tools and methods that:

Reverse Engineer Code: The project includes techniques to decompile and analyze the app’s code, effectively undoing AppSealing’s code obfuscation. This allows the attacker to understand and manipulate the app’s code.

Disable Runtime Protection: The tools provided can detect and disable AppSealing’s real-time monitoring and tampering detection features. This means that any modifications made to the app during its execution go unnoticed, compromising the app’s integrity.

Break Anti-Reverse Engineering Measures: By circumventing the multiple layers of security designed to prevent decompiling, the project exposes the app’s underlying code and structure, making it vulnerable to further attacks.

Decrypt Encrypted Data: The project include methods to bypass or break encryption, allowing attackers to access sensitive data that AppSealing’s encryption is supposed to protect.

Scenario Example  
Consider a banking app protected by AppSealing. This app handles sensitive financial transactions and stores personal information of users. If a malicious actor uses the tools and methods provided in the repository at [private] to bypass AppSealing's protections, they can:

Access Sensitive Data: By reverse engineering the app, the attacker could gain access to encrypted data, such as user passwords and bank account details.  
Manipulate Transactions: The attacker could alter the app's code to perform unauthorized transactions, transferring money from user accounts without their knowledge.  
Bypass Security Checks: Real-time protection and integrity checks could be disabled, allowing the attacker to modify the app’s behavior without detection.  
This compromise not only results in financial loss for users but also damages the bank’s reputation and trust. By using AppSealing’s security measures, such threats are mitigated, ensuring that the banking app remains secure and trustworthy.

Additionally, the repository at https://github.com/LEAGUE-OF-NINE/AppPealing, built on the techniques from the first repository, illustrates a continued and deliberate effort to undermine AppSealing’s technology.
