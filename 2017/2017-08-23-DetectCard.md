**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**  

I am the original author of the repository that faisalim048 copied and removed attribution.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  

Original Repository:
https://github.com/mcred/detect-credit-card-type

Copied Repository:
https://github.com/faisalim048/detect-credit-card-type-using-php

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**  

The entire repository is a blatant copy of my work and removal of attribution violating the MIT license set forth for the project.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  

faisalim048 has forked the project, but the repository that I wish to have taken down is a copy of that fork which removes attribution.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  

The original project is licensed under a MIT license. The violation is that faisalim048 has removed the attribution from the original author. The following commit clearly shows he has simple replaced my name and email address with his own. When I made a comment on this commit to ask why, he disabled comments.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  

This person is also using his copied repository to receive credit for the work on [private]. I will contact this organization later, but since he is using this repository to author a composer package, I believe removal is the only option.

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**
