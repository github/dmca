Subject: DMCA Request - Removal of Intellectual Property

Dear Sir or Madam:

LookingGlass Cyber Solutions is authorized to act on behalf of Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (hereafter Moody's), in requesting removal of Moody's copyrighted works from Internet sites. Under the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. Â§ 512) and other applicable U.S. and international statutes, LookingGlass Cyber Solutions provides this notification of claimed infringement and requests that you immediately remove certain documents from your web site and/or disable access to those documents through your web site.

LookingGlass Cyber Solutions has recently discovered the unauthorized publication, disclosure, and copying of highly sensitive, confidential, trade secret, and copyright-protected documents on the below web site. Specifically, we have confirmed that the documents whose locations and filenames identified at

https://github.com/augjun/devops.git

are confidential and proprietary to Moody's and were posted without Moody's permission. The files included here are, on the whole, copyright violations of Moody's proprietary code.

The unauthorized copying, disclosure and distribution of Moody's confidential trade secret and/or copyright-protected documents constitute a violation of both civil and criminal trade secret and copyright laws.

Based on our preliminary investigation, we believe that this web site is owned and/or controlled by you. Moody's, therefore, requests that you (1) remove these documents from any of the web sites under your control and/or disable access to these documents through any of the web sites under your control, and (2) destroy any and all copies of the documents that you possess.

We also request that you identify to us your source(s) for these documents, so that we may contact them and request that they delete and/or remove the documents that they possess as well.

Moody's is the owner of an exclusive copyright for each of these documents. Moody's is authorized to act on behalf of Moody's, and has a good faith belief that the publication and/or disclosure by your web site is not authorized by Moody's, any of Moody's agents, or the law.

Nothing herein shall constitute a waiver of any of Moody's rights in law or in equity, all of which are expressly reserved.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

Sincerely,
