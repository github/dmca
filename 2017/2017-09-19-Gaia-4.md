**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**  
Yes

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

User has made the source code to my asset - which is how I make my income - available to general world:  
https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/42618

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**

All files in the Gaia directory and any sub directories:  
https://github.com/jeremyclarksonandthefortythieves/Red-Elk/tree/master/Assets/Gaia

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

I am happy for user to make their repository private. Failing that the Gaia component needs to be deleted.

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**

No - otherwise i would have contacted direct - this used to be the way GitHub worked and in the past I have been able to get my work removed without resorting to take down notices. Most users do this inadvertently and re-enabling this capability would probably save GitHub a lot of time.
