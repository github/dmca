Dear friends of GitHub,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

My name is [Private], an programmer in Chengdu Pinguo Tech Co, Ltd., which focus on studying real-time image processing technoloies.

Last year, I uploaded our company's private code in Github . Because I am not familiar with Github website setting, I made a mistake to put it on the public website (https://github.com/pinguo) as public code. However, it is private code which belongs to our company. I was intended to put it on our private website （https://github.com/PGWireless）. What's worse , I found that 2 subscribers (https://github.com/Honsec/PGSkinPrettifyEngine、https://github.com/alemic/PGSkinPrettifyEngine ) have forked our code. Recently we found that the same SDK occured in the market and someone use it to sale. It has already caused a huge loss to our company and our customers.

Thus, I hope Github can help us to delete our private code ASAP on the website to avoid wide spread.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Best appreciation for your kindly help!

Thanks Regards

[Private]
