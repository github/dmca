**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

CMU CS Academy is a curriculum provided by Carnegie Mellon University. The copyrighted work in this case is the starter code of our programming exercises. We provide Python programming exercises with starter code that students edit in order to complete the exercise.

The repositories that we are reporting have posted our code included in their solutions to our exercises. Their solutions are mostly exact copies of our starter code, not original work. For example, the file https://github.com/shrimplines/CMU-CS-Academy/commit/6174cf822502098de011cae940495cdcacd6208e has 25 lines of code. ALL 25 of those lines are exact copies of Carnegie Mellon University's material. This is one example but every single file in this repository includes copyrighted work, taken from our website. The user is posting our code.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

academy.cs.cmu.edu
