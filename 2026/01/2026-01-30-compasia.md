I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner of the copyrighted work described below.  
1. Identification of the copyrighted work  
The copyrighted work consists of proprietary and confidential source code owned by CompAsia, developed by its employees in the course of their employment and not authorized for public disclosure or distribution.

The repository was published without authorization by a former employee of CompAsia, who had access to the code solely for employment purposes and has no rights to publish or distribute it.  
  
We discovered this after receiving an AWS notification flagging one of the exposed credentials. The credential had been explicitly committed as an environment variable, which led us to identify the affected repositories.

This original github account stated above is registered with [private] and now has been changed to [private] by the former employee, as per our internal investigation.
