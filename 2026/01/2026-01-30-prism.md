**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] [private] and copyright owner of the Unity scripts and packages in question. These works were created by [private] and the Prism [private] and are published under the Prism License © 2025 on [private] official website. I have not authorized the redistribution of these files on GitHub.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The copyrighted works are original Unity C# scripts and Unity packages created by [private] and the Prism [private], collectively distributed under the Prism License © 2025. These scripts are part of [private] original software assets published on [private] official website and are protected by copyright. The license explicitly prohibits redistribution without authorization. The infringing GitHub repository contains copies of these original scripts and packages.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Access to the scripts is restricted to users who obtain them directly from the official Prism website or the Prism [private] server. Users must verify their membership in the [private] server before receiving the files. The scripts include a license notice that prohibits redistribution, and automated checks or [private] verification enforce that only authorized users can download the content.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused GitHub repository redistributes [private] copyrighted Unity scripts and packages outside of the official Prism distribution channels. By hosting or linking to the files publicly, it bypasses the access controls in place on [private] website and [private] server, which require users to verify before obtaining the content. This allows unauthorized users to access the material without meeting the required conditions.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
