I have read and understood GitHub's "DMCA Notice Submission Guidelines"  
  
I represent UNISOC Technologies Co.,Ltd (“UNISOC”), the exclusive rights holder of certain proprietary source code.  
  
   
  
It has come to our attention that files from the following folders in the specific GitHub repositories have been released without authorization, containing UNISOC's proprietary source code:

The code is proprietary to UNISOC( Predecessor: Spreadtrum ) and was never authorized for public disclosure or redistribution. Uploading the files in the above folders to GitHub Repositories and making them publicly available infringes our exclusive copyright.
