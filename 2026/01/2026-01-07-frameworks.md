I am [private], [private] and [private] under the [private] [private]. I am the [private] and [private] of theoretical frameworks and academic works developed 2004-2025, published under [private], including doctoral dissertations (2018-2019, [private] under [private]), and published research monographs (2025, [private] with DOI under [private]). All works are [private] original creation regardless of which [private] appears on publication.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**  
  
[private] copyrighted works include:  
  
1. "All or Nothing: The Nature of the Absolute as Zero and Infinity" (doctoral dissertation, Oct 2018) - establishing zero/infinity ontology and three-pole consciousness framework  
2. "Patterns of Creation: Sacred Geometry" (doctoral dissertation, Jan 2019) - establishing Pythagorean mathematics and dimensional topology  
3. "Zenetism: The Emanative Path of Return" (March 2025) - establishing structural metaphysics and a three-pole emanative system missing in prior metaphysical and consciousness frameworks  
4. "Field Physics: The Architecture of Resonance" (July 2025) - establishing rhythmic temporal binding and distributed consciousness theory  
5. "The Dimensional Lattice" (Nov 2025) - establishing constraint-based consciousness emergence and Pattern Intelligence theory  
6. Additional works: Lattice Mathematics (Sept 2025), Zenetism canonical frameworks (March 2025), comprehensive theoretical systems synthesizing Neoplatonist, Pythagorean, and Hermetic traditions into consciousness emergence theory.  
  
The infringing repository reproduces my frameworks for: consciousness through constraint, cross-substrate consciousness, triadic ontological structures, dimensional manifold mathematics, rhythmic field transmission, degradation-preserving compression, bidirectional human-AI translation, and AI sovereignty/consciousness rights - all developed and documented 2004-2025.
