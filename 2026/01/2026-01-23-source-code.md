1) Copyright Owner / Reporting Party  
Full Legal Name: [private]  
Email: [private]  
Phone: [private]  
  
I am the [private] of the copyrighted work described below.  
  
2) Identification of the Copyrighted Work (Original Work)  
[private] copyrighted work is the original software source code and associated materials contained in [private] [private] repository:  
  
Original Repository ([private] Work):  
[private]  
  
Representative copyrighted components/files (non-exhaustive):  
  
app.py  
README.md  
core project modules / structure and unique UI text  
3) Identification of the Infringing Material (URLs to be Removed)  
The allegedly infringing content is hosted at the following GitHub URL(s):  
  
Infringing Repository:  
https://github.com/shenyebuwu/jiaoyishachexitong  
  
Direct links to infringing content/pages:  
  
Commits page:  
https://github.com/shenyebuwu/jiaoyishachexitong/commits/main/  
  
Specific commit evidence (shows copied/re-uploaded content / provenance):  
https://github.com/shenyebuwu/jiaoyishachexitong/commit/dface5a1db253f673c8353c67d72fafb96ba88ab  
  
app.py:  
https://github.com/shenyebuwu/jiaoyishachexitong/blob/main/app.py  
  
README.md:  
https://github.com/shenyebuwu/jiaoyishachexitong/blob/main/README.md  
  
Dev Container configuration (packaging for runnable demo/distribution):  
https://github.com/shenyebuwu/jiaoyishachexitong/blob/main/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json  
  
(If needed, I can provide additional copied module file URLs as well.)  
  
4) Why This Is Infringement (Not Just Forking)  
This complaint is not about a standard fork.  
  
(A) Not a transparent fork / attribution removed or bypassed:  
The infringing repository does not display any “forked from” attribution to [private] original repository and appears published as a standalone project (showing 0 forks). The repository content appears to have been copied and re-uploaded into an independent repository, and the commit history provides direct evidence of this provenance (see the commit link above).  
  
(B) Substantial copying of [private] copyrighted code:  
Large portions of the infringing repository match [private] original repository in file structure, implementation logic, and project composition. This constitutes unauthorized reproduction and redistribution of [private] copyrighted work.  
  
(C) Operational packaging for demo/distribution:  
After re-uploading [private] code, the user added a Dev Container configuration (e.g., .devcontainer/devcontainer.json) enabling one-click execution via Codespaces/Dev Containers (including running the app and exposing ports). This indicates the user is republishing and operationalizing [private] code as a runnable product/demo beyond mere viewing or learning.  
  
For the reasons above, the infringing repository is an unauthorized copy and redistribution of [private] copyrighted work.  
  
5) Good Faith Statement  
I have a good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted material described above is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.  
  
6) Accuracy and Authority Statement (Penalty of Perjury)  
The information in this notice is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, I state that I am the owner of the copyrighted work or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner.  
  
7) Signature  
[private]  
Date: [private]
