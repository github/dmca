Subject: DMCA Takedown Notice   
   
Dear GitHub   
   
We hereby provide this notice in compliance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), 17 U.S.C. § 512, to request the removal of the infringing content described below. This notice is given under penalty of perjury, and I declare that I am the copyright owner or an agent authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.   
   
Copyrighted Work(s) Infringed   
   
Muse Group is the owner of Musescore.com (“Musescore”), an online platform library that sells and/or makes available online scores for individual, non-commercial use. Musescore has oƯered such content for several years, including from the 2020-21 time period (Copyrighted Material), as shown by the archived screen shot in Figure 1.

Figure 1 – Copyrighted Material on Musescore.com from Sept. 02, 2021 (captured by https://web.archive.org/web/20210902195717/https://musescore.com/)   
   
All content, both official and user generated, have been under license from various publishers and copyright holders.   
   
Infringing Content   
It has been brought to our attention that Copyrighted Material from 2020-21 is being made available on your platform at the following location:   
   
o https://github.com/Xmader/musescore-dataset (Infringing Material)   
   
The GitHub user “Xmader” (User) is making available the Infringing Material without our consent or permission, despite previous requests and warnings from the Muse Group to remove Infringing Material.   
   
The Infringing Data appears to consist of not only the actual sheet music files, but also the metadata of both the scores and sheet music and the users themselves. This is essentially the full dataset of what was available on Musescore.   
   
When a user downloads anything from Musescore, they must agree to the Terms of Service (TOS) which is attached at Annex 1. In the TOS it expressly states that:   
   
“You may not use the Service to upload, distribute, transmit, communicate, link to, publish or access any data, information or material through, using or otherwise in connection with the Service, that ….. (b) violates any law or regulation or the rights of others; …. (d) infringes any intellectual property, proprietary rights or confidentiality obligations of others.”   
   
This language from the TOS has remained unchanged since the date the original Copyrighted Material was posted in the 2020-21 time period. See e.g. Musescore.com Terms of Service dated June 15, 2021, as preserved by the Internet Archive at https://web.archive.org/web/20210901135433/https://musescore.com/legal/terms   
   
Musescore.com is there to provide individuals with the possibility to share and discover music for their own personal use and enjoyment. It has not been created so others may compile their own data libraries consisting of Musescore’s music-sheet data and user metadata.   
   
The User has copied and converted the Copyrighted Material for distribution to others, in direct violation of not only the TOS, but our rights as copyright holders of the Copyrighted Material. Furthermore, the TOS provides clear evidence that the User was aware of the restrictions, and they continued to make available the Infringing Material.   
   
It is a clear intention of the User to not only use the Infringing Material for their own unauthorised use, but also to share the Infringing Material with the general public in the hopes they will also use it for their own purposes.   
   
Next Steps   
   
Given the scale of infringement that has occurred here, you can understand how concerning this is for us. We request that the Infringing Material be removed immediately from your platform, and the User contacted to inform them.   
   
I have a good faith belief that the use of the Copyrighted Material, as described above, is not authorised by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.   
   
I declare under penalty of perjury that the information in this notice is accurate, and that I am the copyright owner or authorised to act on behalf of the copyright owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. I can be reached at the following contact information:   
   
o Name: [private]  
o Email: [private]  
   
We request that the infringing content be removed or disabled as soon as possible, in accordance with the DMCA. I understand that the service provider may need to contact me for further clarification.   
   
Thank you for your prompt attention to this urgent matter.   
   
Sincerely,
