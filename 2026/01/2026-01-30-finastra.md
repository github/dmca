I am writing on behalf of Finastra in my capacity as [private] and have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. This notice is submitted pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 512, to request the removal of unauthorized copyrighted material currently hosted on GitHub. The copyrighted material consists of proprietary Finastra source code contained within the following private internal repository: [private]. The infringing content has been found in the following public GitHub repository, which is not authorized to host or distribute Finastra's source code: ShubhDevelop-luv/agent-servicenow (URL: https://github.com/ShubhDevelop-luv/agent-servicenow). The exposed material is materially identical to Finastra's confidential code and its presence in a public repository constitutes a direct copyright infringement. Moreover, prior to public exposure, various Finastra identifiers within the codebase were partially removed, suggesting deliberate obfuscation of origin.  
  
Finastra is the exclusive owner of the copyrighted material contained in the original private repository. The individual(s) who uploaded this code into the public repository identified above did so without authorization, consent, or license from Finastra. I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law and I have taken fair use into consideration.  
  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.  
  
Finastra requests that GitHub promptly remove or disable access to the infringing repository and any related forks or copies containing the unauthorized Finastra source code. If you have any questions, I can be reached as indicated below.
