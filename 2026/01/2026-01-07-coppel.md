2) Description of the Original Copyrighted Work  
The copyrighted work consists of Coppel’s original internal software artifacts and denominational elements used in corporate viatics management systems (HR/Finance). These include:

Original database schema and table/field naming created for Coppel’s internal workflows.  
Proprietary workflow state names and role nomenclature designed for Coppel’s approval processes.  
Internal email address formats and identifiers tied to Coppel’s systems.

These works are not open‑licensed and are copyright‑protected as authored corporate software/content.

3) Nature of the Infringement — Detailed Explanation  
This is not a generic mention of the Coppel brand. The repository reproduces and implements Coppel’s internal database schema and workflow logic, including specific names, roles, and states that are original authored materials.  

Repository URL: https://github.com/CarlosP170/Gestor-de-Viaticos-coppel  
Key infringing file: https://github.com/CarlosP170/Gestor-de-Viaticos-coppel/blob/main/BasePrincipal.sql

a) Direct reproduction of internal schema and names  
The SQL file defines the database and tables using Coppel’s internal denomination:  
[private]  
These exact table names originate from Coppel’s internal systems and are part of an authored software design, not generic examples.

b) Replication of proprietary workflow states and roles  
The file implements Coppel’s approval states and role nomenclature:  
[private]  

c) Organization‑specific financial structure and identifiers  
The schema replicates Coppel‑specific financial fields:  
[private] is unique to Coppel’s internal platform and is not generic training code.  

d) Impersonation and system labeling  
The project labels the entire system as “GestorViaticosCoppel” and the repository as “Gestor-de-Viaticos-coppel”, thereby impersonating an internal corporate application rather than demonstrating neutral, generic examples.

4) Why this is Coppel’s copyrighted material  
To address your specific question:

The schema, table/field names, roles, and state machine are original authored artifacts from Coppel’s internal software design and documentation, created for Coppel’s HR/Finance workflows.  
The exact denomination and workflow vocabulary (e.g., Solicitudes_Viaticos, Viajes, Notificaciones, roles Colaborador/Gerente/RH, states   Pendiente/Autorizada/Rechazada) match those used by Coppel and are not publicly licensed or distributed.  
The database name GestorViaticosCoppel and the use of coppel.com email formats within seeded data demonstrate intent to replicate the internal system, not a generic educational sample.  
These elements collectively form copyrighted software content authored for Coppel’s internal operations.

5) Infringing Repository and Files

Entire repository: https://github.com/CarlosP170/Gestor-de-Viaticos-coppel  
Primary infringing file: https://github.com/CarlosP170/Gestor-de-Viaticos-coppel/blob/main/BasePrincipal.sql

Because the internal schema and workflow logic are embedded throughout the project, the entire repository is infringing.

6) Requested Action  
Please remove the infringing file and repository (and any forks/mirrors) due to the unauthorized reproduction of Coppel’s copyrighted internal software content.
