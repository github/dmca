Confirmation of Copyright Ownership

I confirm that I am authorized to submit this copyright removal request because I am the [private] [private] and [private] copyright owner of the content identified in the referenced GitHub URL.

[private] [private] authored and developed the firmware and related code at issue. This work was not created as a “work made for hire” within the scope of employment. Moreover, even in the event that the work was created during an engagement with an employer, the applicable written contract explicitly provides that I retain all rights to the developments and code I created. No rights were assigned, transferred, or licensed to any employer or third party that would permit redistribution.

The content was distributed under a Patreon license that expressly prohibits copying, redistribution, or commercial use. The applicable license terms and copyright notice are available here:  
[private]

Additionally, the product page includes the following disclaimer:  
[private]

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The code is an embedded modification to the UEFI BIOS that enables extended functionality for interfacing with the firewall hardware [private] developed.

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Access to the copyrighted software is controlled through a paid license distribution system via Patreon. Distribution is restricted to authorized users, licenses are tracked, and redistribution outside the authorized channel is prohibited.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project redistributes complete copies of the proprietary software outside the authorized distribution channel, thereby bypassing the access controls and license restrictions under which the software is made available. By making the software publicly accessible, the project nullifies the technological and contractual measures used to control access, limit distribution, and track authorized licenses.

Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

I do not have reliable or verified contact information for the alleged infringer beyond their GitHub username.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
