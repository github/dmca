Re: Podimo / GitHub  
Delivery: per registered post and email  
([private])  
   
Dear sir, madam,  
   
On behalf of Podimo ApS (‘‘Podimo’’) we require your immediate attention to the following. This  
correspondence constitutes a formal follow-up of our prior DMCA notification submitted to GitHub under  
ticket number 3951563.  
   
Introduction  
   
1. Podimo is a leading audio entertainment platform, offering premium audio entertainment in local  
languages through award-winning exclusive content, podcasts and audiobooks. Podimo holds  
exclusive rights to a substantial catalogue of original and licensed works and relies on technological  
protection measures and subscription controls to safeguard those rights and the interests of its  
creators. Unauthorized distribution of Podimo’s content causes direct commercial harm to Podimo, its  
creators and its partners.  
   
2. The content offered on the Podimo platform includes among others:  
   
[private] [private] [private]  
   
3. GitHub has thus far responded only with automated messages. Given the scope and seriousness of  
the matter, such responses are absolutely inadequate. Podimo has identified and is actively  
monitoring more than one hundred distinct instances of copyright infringement hosted on GitHub.

Infringement  
   
4. The GitHub user operating under the name “piratkvinden” is using GitHub repositories and GitHub  
Pages to reproduce, and make available to the public Podimo’s exclusive, subscription-only  
catalogue. The infringing material includes protected podcast episodes, audiobooks, and artwork,  
totaling in excess of one hundred copyrighted titles. The primary repository hosting this material is located at https://github.com/piratkvinden/podcast, with distribution occurring via GitHub Pages at https://piratkvinden.github.io/podcast/#, all linked to the user profile available at https://github.com/piratkvinden.  
   
[private]  
   
5. Github’s involvement in the infringing activity comprises two distinct categories of infringement.  
   
6. First, it hosts and distributes Podimo’s copyrighted works via user repositories, enabling  
unauthorized reproduction and distribution. As shown below, the enclosed URLs directly link to  
Podimo’s protected content enabling users to download the content. The Podimo folder within the  
repository consists exclusively of unauthorized copies from the Podimo platform,  
https://github.com/piratkvinden/podcast/tree/main/Podimo.  
   
[private]  
   
[private]  
   
7. In addition, through the GitHub Pages (i) https://piratkvinden.github.io/podcast/# it actively publishes  
and hosts the infringing content.  
   
[private]  
   
8. As an intermediary providing services within the EU, GitHub is subject to the Digital Services Act  
(Regulation (EU) 2022/2065). Under Article 6, GitHub may benefit from liability exemptions (safe  
harbor) only if it acts expeditiously to remove or disable access to illegal content upon obtaining  
knowledge thereof. Given the scale and systematic nature of the infringement in this case, GitHub  
also bears a duty under the DSA’s notice-and-action framework to ensure that the same illegal  
content does not simply reappear, which in this case requires terminating the account of a repeat  
infringer. In addition, these activities constitute clear violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act  
(1998).  
   
9. Accordingly, Podimo formally requests that you confirm in writing, without delay, that GitHub will:  
   
A. immediately cease and desist from making available, and will remove and keep removed, all  
access to the repository identified in paragraph 5 as containing infringing content;  
B. immediately cease and desist from making available, and will remove and keep removed, all  
access to the associated GitHub Pages, identified in paragraph 6, through which the infringing  
content is made available;  
C. take appropriate measures to ensure that the infringing content is not restored or otherwise  
made available again through the same or any related account; and  
D. provide Podimo ApS with written confirmation once the infringing content has been removed  
and access has been disabled.  
   
10. If we do not receive this confirmation from you in a timely manner, Podimo will initiate legal proceedings, in which it will seek, inter alia, the immediate cessation of the infringement, full compensation for the damage suffered by Podimo and reimbursement of the full legal costs incurred by Podimo. In addition we will file a formal complaint regarding non-compliance with the DSA.  
   
We trust that the above is sufficiently clear and expect a substantive, non-automated response, along with written confirmation of the takedown actions taken, before [private] COB.  
   
Sincerely,  
[private], [private]  
Podimo ApS
