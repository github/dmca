Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The repository redistributes PlanningAlerts content and derived data while failing to comply with the requirements of GPLv2, including:  
1. The repository does not provide the text of the GPL licence.  
2. The repository does not clearly preserve copyright and licence notices from PlanningAlerts.  
3. The repository does not provide complete corresponding source where redistributed material originates from the PlanningAlerts codebase.

In addition, website content copied from PlanningAlerts is redistributed without attribution and without preserving licence terms.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

To bring the repository into compliance, the owner would need to:  
1. Clearly identify any PlanningAlerts-derived content.  
2. Preserve and display appropriate copyright and licence notices.  
3. Include the full GPLv2 licence text.  
4. Provide complete corresponding source for any redistributed PlanningAlerts code or derivative works.

If the repository owner is unwilling to comply with these requirements, the infringing material should be removed.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
