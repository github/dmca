**How do you believe the license is being violated?**  
  
The MIT License requires that the original copyright notice and attribution  
be retained in all copies or substantial portions of the software.  
  
The infringing repository copies [private] Milestone 2 source code, Streamlit  
application logic, README documentation, and deployment workflow, but  
does not provide attribution to [private] as the original author and replaces  
the copyright information.  
  
Presenting the copied work as original authorship violates the attribution  
and copyright retention requirements of the MIT License.  
  
**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**  
  
To bring the repository into compliance, the infringing content should be  
removed or disabled.  
  
Alternatively, compliance would require clearly attributing the original  
author, restoring the original copyright notice, retaining the MIT License,  
and clearly indicating that the work is derived from [private] repository.  
  
Until such changes are made, the content remains in violation of the license.
