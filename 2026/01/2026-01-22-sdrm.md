Dear Madam, Dear Sir,    
  
   
  
We have read and understand GitHub's guide to filing a DMCA notice.  
  
   
  
Our company Noticio represents the society SACEM (Society of Authors, Composers and Publishers of Music) and the society SDRM (Society for the Administration of Mechanical Reproduction Rights of authors, composers, publishers), having their registered offices at [private], and as legal representative [private], [private], are collective management organizations, established as sociétés civiles governed by Articles L. 321-1 to L. 328-2 of the French Intellectual Property Code.    
  
    
  
Please find attached the Certificate of Agency and do not hesitate to see the societies’ world’s largest repertory of works on https://repertoire.sacem.fr/en    
  
    
  
SACEM’s members assign to it on an exclusive basis their communication to the public and public performance right and mechanical reproduction right on all their works as soon as created. SACEM has delegated to SDRM the management of the mechanical reproduction rights of its members.    
  
   
  
SACEM and SDRM therefore have sole authority to grant the authorizations for the exploitation of the communication to the public and public performance right and mechanical reproduction right of the works which belong to their repertoire.    
  
Moreover, SACEM, for the communication to the public and public performance right, and SACEM and SDRM, for the mechanical reproduction right, have entered into representation agreements with musical authors’ societies from over 90 countries according to which they manage such societies’ repertoires for the exploitations taking place in the French territory.

However, we have established that this repository, available at https://github.com/almottier/prowlarr-ygg, provides a modified version of Prowlarr ([private]), a BitTorrent indexer specifically dedicated to the illicit [private] service, enabling the search for and access to content referenced on the [private] platform and thereby facilitating access to protected works without the necessary authorisations from the rights holders.   
  
Most importantly, the [private] service is included on French Digital Services Coordinator Arcom's list of illegal services:

(...)” (Article L.335-5 par. 1)

Finally, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act provides, in its section 1201, section 512 and section 1203, that :

is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing protection afforded by a technological measure that effectively protects a right of a copyright owner under this title in a work or a portion thereof;” (Section 1201),  
   
  
“A service provider shall not be liable for monetary relief, or, except as provided in subsection (j), for injunctive or other equitable relief, for infringement of copyright by reason of the provider referring or linking users to an online location containing infringing material or infringing activity, by using information location tools, including a directory, index, reference, pointer, or hypertext link, if the service provider  
  
(1)  
  
(A) does not have actual knowledge that the material or activity is infringing;

(3)  
  
upon notification of claimed infringement as described in subsection (c)(3), responds expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity, except that, for purposes of this paragraph, the information described in subsection (c)(3)(A)(iii) shall be identification of the reference or link, to material or activity claimed to be infringing, that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate that reference or link. “ (Section 512) ;
