**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I, [private], am the [private] [private] and copyright owner of MakerKit, a commercial SaaS starter kit built with Next.js and Supabase. MakerKit is sold exclusively through makerkit.dev under a proprietary license that prohibits redistribution, sublicensing, or public sharing of the source code. I hold exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute, display, and create derivative works of MakerKit.

I am not acting on behalf of another party - I am the [private] and [private].

The original repositories are in this organization: [private]

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

MakerKit is a commercial SaaS starter kit that provides a complete foundation for building subscription-based web applications. It includes proprietary implementations of authentication systems, billing integration, multi-tenancy architecture, admin panels, database schemas, API routes, and UI components - all developed exclusively by [private] over several years.

The reported repositories contain unauthorized copies of MakerKit's proprietary source code:

- https://github.com/MyPraxisAI/AI-notetaking-for-psychotherapists - This repository fully republishes MakerKit's codebase. The commit history visibly demonstrates this is a direct copy of [private] work.

- https://github.com/JanDoeTian/walkie - The subfolder walkie-web (https://github.com/JanDoeTian/walkie/tree/main/walkie-web) contains the entirety of MakerKit's proprietary code. The commit history has been deleted, but the infringing content remains.

Both repositories violate my exclusive rights as copyright holder by publicly distributing code that is sold under a commercial license explicitly prohibiting such redistribution.

Note on partial repository infringement:
The fact that one repository embeds MakerKit within a subfolder of a larger monorepo does not diminish the infringement. Publishing the entirety of a copyrighted work without authorization is a complete violation of my copyright, regardless of whether it is presented standalone or as part of a larger project. My exclusive right to control distribution is violated the moment the code is made publicly accessible. There is no "fair use" defense for republishing an entire commercial product's source code - such use is neither transformative nor limited in scope.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**
