I have read and understand GitHub’s Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I am writing on behalf of Blue Wizard Digital Ltd (“BWD”), the copyright owner of the browser-based video game “Soccer Bros” (computer software and audiovisual work). This email is a DMCA takedown notice requesting removal/disablement of access to infringing material hosted on GitHub Pages.

1) Copyrighted work claimed to be infringed  
“Soccer Bros” – a browser-based video game, including its compiled web build (JavaScript/HTML5 distribution files), original artwork, animations, audio, UI assets, and associated branding/trade dress.

2) Authorized example(s) of the copyrighted work  
https://soccerbros.gg/

3) Infringing material to be removed/disabled (GitHub-hosted)  
The infringing copy is publicly accessible via GitHub Pages at:  
https://jasongamesdev.github.io/soccer-bros/  
https://jasongamesdev.github.io/soccer-bros/SoccerBros.js  
https://jasongamesdev.github.io/soccer-bros/SoccerBros.js?th=120

These URLs host and serve an unauthorized playable copy of “Soccer Bros” and its assets without permission from Blue Wizard Digital Ltd.

Note: The backing repository does not appear to be publicly accessible (the account shows no public repositories), so I cannot provide a public repository URL. Please locate the associated repository internally and disable GitHub Pages and/or remove the infringing content accordingly.

4) Good faith belief  
I have a good-faith belief that the use of the copyrighted material described above is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

5) Accuracy and authority / perjury statement  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notice is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
