**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

gnu-general-public-license-v2.0

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The GPL v2 license permits copying and modification only if its conditions are met. The repository identified above reproduces [private] GPL v2–licensed code without complying with these conditions. Specifically, original authorship attribution and copyright notices have been removed or altered, and the copied files are presented as original work of the repository owner. This constitutes a violation of GPL v2 license requirements and results in unauthorized use of my copyrighted contributions.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

To bring the repository into compliance with GPL v2, the repository owner must preserve original copyright notices and authorship attribution for all copied files, clearly attribute the upstream project and contributors, include the full GPL v2 license text, and cease presenting copied code as original work. Alternatively, the infringing files may be removed from the repository.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
