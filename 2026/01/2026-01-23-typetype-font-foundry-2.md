Hello , 
 
My name is [private], I'm a [private] of TypeType Font Foundry. 
 
TypeType is engaged in the development of fonts (i.e. software for creating digital typefaces) and is the creator and exclusive rights holder of the TT Ricordi Greto font (the "Work") and its worldwide distributor. An authorized example of the Work can be found at https://typetype.org/fonts/tt-ricordi-greto/ 
 
The Work is currently being used on the "https://staridvor.hr/" (the "Website"). The fact of using the Work on the Website is confirmed by means of FontNinja identifier application; And in the network page code as well - https://staridvor.hr/fonts/TT-Ricordi-Greto-Trial-Regular.ttf Screenshots are attached. 
 
Unfortunately, there is no information in our records to confirm licensed use of the Work for use on this Website. We have contacted the owner of the site at many corporate emails and have asked for confirmation of the font license information. And if the site owner does not have a license, we offer to purchase the appropriate font license to cover the use. As a result of the appeal, we did not receive a final response to resolve this issue from the contact persons-holders of the aforementioned domain. 
 
In view of the above, please notify the owner of this site of this copyright infringement and the need to contact us directly as a matter of urgency to resolve this matter promptly. 
 
I provide this notice in good faith and with a reasonable belief that the rights held by TypeType are being infringed.   
I have a good-faith belief that use of the materials described above as allegedly infringing is not authorized by the owner, its agent, or the law I have taken fair use into consideration.  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright/trademark owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. 
 
I look forward to your response.
