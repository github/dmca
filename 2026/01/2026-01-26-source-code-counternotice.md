I have read and understand GitHub’s Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice.

The disabled content was located at:  
https://github.com/VikrantKuntal1/GPS-Based-Toll-Collection-System

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification.

This repository contains original work that [private] independently developed. Although the concept originated from a college project discussion, [private] rewrote the implementation from scratch, including the logic, architecture, and smart contracts. No code was copied from the claimant’s repository. The tech stack, structure, and implementation differ entirely.

I consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (or, if outside the United States, the Northern District of California), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or their agent.
