Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.

Based on the above, I confirm that:

The entire repository is infringing

If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately. Please read more about forks.
