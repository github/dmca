I am the [private] and [private] copyright owner of the Obsidian plugin “note-to-mp”, which [private] independently developed and have continuously maintained for over two years.

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**  
  
**Based on the above, I confirm that:**  
  
The entire repository is infringing  
  
**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**  
  
https://github.com/IsHexx/WDWXEdit  
  
**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**  
  
No  
  
**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**  
  
**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**  
  
Yes  
  
**Which license?**  
  
mit-license  
  
**How do you believe the license is being violated?**  
  
The original work is licensed under the MIT License, which permits reuse, modification, and redistribution only if the copyright notice and the full license text are included in all copies or substantial portions of the software, and if the original authorship is not misrepresented.  
  
The accused repository violates the MIT License in multiple ways:  
  
1. Removal of copyright notice and license text  
The repository does not include [private] copyright notice or the MIT License text, despite distributing substantial portions of [private] code.  
  
2. Failure to provide attribution to the original author  
The repository does not acknowledge [private] as the original author of the copied code in any documentation, license file, or source distribution.  
  
3. Misrepresentation of authorship  
The repository owner publicly claims that the plugin was “developed from scratch” and that most of the code was generated by AI tools (Codex and Claude Code), which is demonstrably false given the extensive verbatim reuse of [private] original code.  
  
4. Distribution of a bundled derivative work without license compliance  
The accused project distributes a compiled/bundled main.js file that contains substantial portions of [private] original source code, without preserving the required license and attribution, which constitutes unauthorized redistribution under the MIT License.  
  
Because these conditions are not met, the accused use is outside the scope of the MIT License and therefore constitutes copyright infringement.  
  
**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**  
  
Given the nature of the infringement, the following actions are required to bring the project into compliance:  
  
1. Complete Removal of Infringing Code: Since the core functionality and architecture of the project (specifically the main.js file) are entirely derived from my copyrighted source code without authorization or attribution, the infringing code must be removed in its entirety.  
  
2. Proper Attribution and License Compliance: If the user wishes to use any portion of my MIT-licensed code in the future, they must strictly adhere to the license terms by including the original copyright notice and the MIT license text in all copies or substantial portions of the software.  
  
3. Correction of False Claims: The infringer must cease and desist from making false claims regarding the authorship of the code (e.g., claiming it was "developed from scratch using AI") in the repository's README and any associated promotional materials.  
  
However, since the project's current state is built upon a direct and uncredited misappropriation of [private] entire work, simply adding a license is insufficient. The infringing repository should be taken down.  
  
**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**  
  
**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**  
  
**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**  
  
**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**  
  
**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
