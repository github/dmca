Hello GitHub Trust & Safety team,  
I am part of Accenture [private], authorized to act on behalf of BanCoppel S.A. Institución de Banca Múltiple, for copyright enforcement, brand protection, and intellectual property matters.  
I am submitting a DMCA takedown notice for unauthorized use of copyrighted and trademark‑protected BanCoppel brand assets within this repository.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**
 
1. Copyright Ownership  
BanCoppel S.A. de C.V. holds exclusive rights over:

the official BanCoppel corporate logo  
graphical brand identity assets  
raster and vector renderings of the BanCoppel mark (PNG, JPG, SVG)  
all stylized, derivative, or mirrored versions of the logo  

These materials are protected under Mexican copyright and trademark law.  
Trademark registration (IMPI):  
https://marcia.impi.gob.mx/marcas/search/details/RM202303059753  
Official website:  
https://www.bancoppel.com  

2. Description of the Infringement  
This repository includes an unauthorized reproduction of the official BanCoppel logo in PNG format.  
Infringing file:  
https://github.com/angelortiztertius/HipotecarioBancoppel/blob/main/LogoBancoppel.png  
This file:

displays the BanCoppel logo in full and unaltered form  
is used in a repository named “HipotecarioBancoppel”, which directly references a financial product category (hipotecario/mortgage)  
creates a false impression of affiliation with BanCoppel’s official financial services  
is redistributed publicly without authorization, license, or brand approval  

This is not fair use.  
The logo is used in a context that implies endorsement of a financial service, amplifying the risk of confusion for users.

3. Infringing Repository  
Repository URL:  
https://github.com/angelortiztertius/HipotecarioBancoppel  
Because the infringing content is embedded within the project’s public directory and tied to a financial‑services naming context, removal of the infringing file—or the repository if necessary—is required under the DMCA.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

https://www.bancoppel.com

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**
