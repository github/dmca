The accused project is an unauthorized copy of our proprietary source code that was obtained by bypassing our access control measures. The code was stored in a [private] [private] [private] and secured servers that required authorized credentials to access.

The infringing party gained unauthorized access to our systems, copied the protected source code and backend configuration files, and then republished them publicly on GitHub. By publishing the copied code in a public repository, the accused project effectively removes and circumvents our original access restrictions, allowing unrestricted public access to material that was intended to remain private and protected.
