Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

I believe that this takedown was the result of a mistake or misidentification. The current state of the repository does not, to my knowledge, contain copyrighted assets, code, or material from [private] or The Escapists.

This project is a fan-made reimplementation and uses only original assets. Any placeholder or temporary materials used during early development were removed prior to the repository's current state.

The claim that the entire repository is infringing is therefore not accurate. If access is restored, [private] willing to take additional precautionary steps to ensure the repository history clearly reflects this and to avoid future confusion.
