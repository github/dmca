**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The allegedly infringing repository reproduces and is substantially derived from [private] original mod, Starred, which [private] authored and own the copyright to.

At the time the Zen mod was developed, Starred was publicly accessible. The Zen repository copies Starred’s internal implementations, including but not limited to the internal configuration system design, configuration DSL structure and logic, data storage APIs, and feature implementations such as the Slayer-related features. This code was not publicly documented or exposed in a manner that would permit independent reimplementation.

Although variable names or surface-level formatting may differ, the underlying structure, logic, APIs, and architectural decisions in Zen are substantially similar to [private] copyrighted work. No license, permission, or authorization was granted to Zen to copy, use, or derive from this code.

The copied internals form the foundation of the Zen mod and are integrated throughout its codebase. Because these infringing components define the project’s core functionality, design patterns, and internal APIs, the Zen repository cannot be separated into infringing and non-infringing portions. As a result, I am explicitly asserting that the Zen repository in its entirety constitutes a derivative work of [private] copyrighted code, and the infringement is not limited to specific files or isolated sections.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

https://github.com/MrFast-js/zen-1.21  
https://github.com/benjilmao/zen-1.21  
https://github.com/David13374/zen-1.21  
https://github.com/Eclipse-5214/zen-1.21  
https://github.com/Bloxigus/zen
https://github.com/WarpWing/zen

**Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

[private]

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
