**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

mit-license

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The repository includes an MIT license file, but it lists only their own copyright.
Because they have copied substantial portions of [private] original code, the MIT license
requires that [private] original copyright notice also be included. Despite multiple
requests, they have not added [private] notice, and the copied code remains attributed
only to them. This does not comply with the terms of the MIT license.

Examples of copied material:

1. ByteBuffer (renamed from [private] Buffer implementation)

Original:  
https://github.com/OmniacDev/MCBE-IPC/blob/9187bd02031a39a334137a2c2742343c7c4574e5/src/ipc.ts#L36-L124

Copied version:  
https://github.com/gamezaSRC/Bedrock-IPC/blob/main/src/proto/ByteBuffer.ts

Although renamed and with minor variable/method changes, the internal logic is substantially the same.

2. HeaderCodec (renamed from [private] MIPS implementation)

Original:  
https://github.com/OmniacDev/MCBE-IPC/blob/9187bd02031a39a334137a2c2742343c7c4574e5/src/ipc.ts#L126-L152

Copied version:  
https://github.com/gamezaSRC/Bedrock-IPC/blob/main/src/net/encoding/HeaderCodec.ts

Despite renaming the class and methods, the underlying functionality and logic remain essentially identical.

3. PacketEncoder (renamed from [private] NET implementation)

Original:   
https://github.com/OmniacDev/MCBE-IPC/blob/9187bd02031a39a334137a2c2742343c7c4574e5/src/ipc.ts#L459-L509

Copied version:  
https://github.com/gamezaSRC/Bedrock-IPC/blob/main/src/net/encoding/PacketEncoder.ts

The original serialize/deserialize functions were moved from a namespace into a static class wrapper and renamed, but the internal logic remains almost identical.

4. HeaderData / HeaderSerializer, and generateId (renamed from [private] Header interface and serializer)

Original interface + serializer:  
https://github.com/OmniacDev/MCBE-IPC/blob/9187bd02031a39a334137a2c2742343c7c4574e5/src/ipc.ts#L435-L449

Copied version:  
https://github.com/gamezaSRC/Bedrock-IPC/blob/main/src/net/encoding/Header.ts

5. MessageEmitter (emit method copied from [private] NET implementation)

Original:  
https://github.com/OmniacDev/MCBE-IPC/blob/9187bd02031a39a334137a2c2742343c7c4574e5/src/ipc.ts#L568-L592

Copied version:  
https://github.com/gamezaSRC/Bedrock-IPC/blob/main/src/net/messages/MessageEmitter.ts

The emit method was copied directly and moved under the MessageEmitter class, with only type and name changes.

6. MessageListener (listen method and scriptevent handler copied from [private] NET implementation)

Original listen method:  
https://github.com/OmniacDev/MCBE-IPC/blob/9187bd02031a39a334137a2c2742343c7c4574e5/src/ipc.ts#L594-L626

https://github.com/gamezaSRC/Bedrock-IPC/blob/bc8ba8832119e53cb33d506d9d6c2fd231e00ad0/src/net/messages/MessageListener.ts#L84-L127

The listen method was copied with only minor changes, and the functional logic is essentially identical.

Original scriptevent listener:   
https://github.com/OmniacDev/MCBE-IPC/blob/9187bd02031a39a334137a2c2742343c7c4574e5/src/ipc.ts#L511-L538

https://github.com/gamezaSRC/Bedrock-IPC/blob/bc8ba8832119e53cb33d506d9d6c2fd231e00ad0/src/net/messages/MessageListener.ts#L44-L75

The scriptevent listener was copied and extracted into a new handleEvent method with only minor renaming.

7. EndpointManager (create_listener copied and renamed to register)

Original:  
https://github.com/OmniacDev/MCBE-IPC/blob/9187bd02031a39a334137a2c2742343c7c4574e5/src/ipc.ts#L540-L556

8. CollectionSerializers (copied from [private] serializer definitions)

Original:  
https://github.com/OmniacDev/MCBE-IPC/blob/9187bd02031a39a334137a2c2742343c7c4574e5/src/ipc.ts#L325-L433

Copied version:  
https://github.com/gamezaSRC/Bedrock-IPC/blob/main/src/proto/serializers/CollectionSerializers.ts

All serializer definitions were copied, moved into classes, and lightly renamed, while the functionality remains identical.

9. PrimitiveSerializers (copied from [private] serializer definitions)

Original:  
https://github.com/OmniacDev/MCBE-IPC/blob/9187bd02031a39a334137a2c2742343c7c4574e5/src/ipc.ts#L154-L304

Copied version:  
https://github.com/gamezaSRC/Bedrock-IPC/blob/main/src/proto/serializers/PrimitiveSerializers.ts

10. SpecialSerializers (Date serializer copied from [private] implementation)

Original:  
https://github.com/OmniacDev/MCBE-IPC/blob/9187bd02031a39a334137a2c2742343c7c4574e5/src/ipc.ts#L316-L323

Copied version:  
https://github.com/gamezaSRC/Bedrock-IPC/blob/main/src/proto/serializers/SpecialSerializers.ts

The Date serializer was copied directly and converted into a class with only minor renames.

11. StringSerializer (string and uint8array serializers copied from [private] implementation)

Original string + uint8array serializers:  
https://github.com/OmniacDev/MCBE-IPC/blob/9187bd02031a39a334137a2c2742343c7c4574e5/src/ipc.ts#L306-L315  
https://github.com/OmniacDev/MCBE-IPC/blob/9187bd02031a39a334137a2c2742343c7c4574e5/src/ipc.ts#L278-L295

Copied version:  
https://github.com/gamezaSRC/Bedrock-IPC/blob/main/src/proto/serializers/StringSerializer.ts

12. Serializer (copied from [private] Serializable interface)

Original:  
https://github.com/OmniacDev/MCBE-IPC/blob/9187bd02031a39a334137a2c2742343c7c4574e5/src/ipc.ts#L29-L32

Copied version:  
https://github.com/gamezaSRC/Bedrock-IPC/blob/main/src/proto/Serializer.ts

13. IPCClient (send, invoke, on, once, and handle copied from [private] IPC namespace)

Original:  
https://github.com/OmniacDev/MCBE-IPC/blob/9187bd02031a39a334137a2c2742343c7c4574e5/src/ipc.ts#L628-L686

Copied version:  
https://github.com/gamezaSRC/Bedrock-IPC/blob/main/src/client/IPCClient.ts

The send, invoke, on, once, and handle methods were copied with only minor changes while keeping the same underlying logic.

Although the code has been split into multiple files and some identifiers were
renamed, the implementation remains substantially copied from [private] original work.
Reformatting or reorganizing does not remove the requirement to include [private] MIT
license notice.
