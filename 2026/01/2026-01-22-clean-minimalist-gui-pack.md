Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.

I am the [private] and copyright owner of the original work.

Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.

The original copyrighted work is the following asset for Unity:

- Clean & Minimalist GUI Pack: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/clean-minimalist-gui-pack-75123

The infringing URLs are redistributing the entire contents of the asset, and you can confirm this by inspecting the ‘Package Content’ section of the original link above. Most of the contents of the asset are 2D sprites and C# scripts. Examining the contents of the infringing repositories, you can confirm every single script in the infringing folders belongs to our asset and even includes our original copyright notice in its header:

[private]

We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.

Based on the above, I confirm that:

Specific files within the repository are infringing.

Identify only the specific file URLs within the repository that is infringing:

The infringing files are all the files contained in the following folders:

https://github.com/togedaeng/unity/tree/main/Assets/GUIPack-Clean%26Minimalist  
https://github.com/27657237/HanZiShouWeiZhan/tree/main/Assets/GUIPack-Clean%26Minimalist

Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology if you are unsure.

No.

Is the work licensed under an open source license?

No.

What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?

Repository can be made private.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

I have taken fair use into consideration.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice.
