Hello GitHub Trust & Safety team,  
I am part of Accenture [private], authorized to act on behalf of Coppel S.A. de C.V. for copyright enforcement, brand protection, and intellectual property matters.  
I am submitting a DMCA takedown notice regarding the unauthorized use of copyrighted and trademark‑protected Coppel brand assets and internal training materials contained within this repository.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**  
  
1. Copyright Ownership  
Coppel S.A. de C.V. holds exclusive rights over:  
  
the official Coppel corporate logo  
graphic identity elements  
raster/vector renderings of the logo (PNG, JPG, SVG, PDF embeddings)  
internal training content and authored materials produced by Universidad Corporativa Coppel  
all derivative or stylized versions of any protected corporate documentation  
  
These works are protected under Mexican and international copyright/trademark law.  
Trademark registration (IMPI):  
https://marcia.impi.gob.mx/marcas/search/details/RM202403127110  
Official website:  
https://www.coppel.com  
  
2. Description of the Infringement  
The repository contains three unauthorized PDF documents that include:  
  
the full, unaltered official Coppel logos  
branding from Universidad Corporativa Coppel  
internal assignments/training material meant for private corporate use  
authored content belonging exclusively to Coppel educational programs  
  
Infringing files:  
  
https://github.com/AntonioGonzalez8520/IDS_coppel/blob/main/GuillermoOrduno_A2.pdf  
https://github.com/AntonioGonzalez8520/IDS_coppel/blob/main/Guillermoorduno_A1.pdf  
https://github.com/AntonioGonzalez8520/IDS_coppel/blob/main/Guillermoorduno_A3.pdf  
  
These files:  
  
contain full copies of copyrighted corporate training exercises  
include embedded Coppel logos and branding without authorization  
are authored internal learning materials, not public documents  
are redistributed publicly without license or permission  
may mislead users into believing they are permitted for public distribution  
  
This is not fair use.  
The PDFs are not used for commentary or analysis—they are reproduced in full and offered publicly.  
  
3. Infringing Repository
