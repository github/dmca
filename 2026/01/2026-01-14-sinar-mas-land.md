**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am an authorized representative of SOCRadar, a cyber threat intelligence platform retained by Sinar Mas Land to monitor and protect their intellectual property and digital assets. Sinar Mas Land is one of Indonesia’s largest and most prominent property developers. The repository in question contains unauthorized proprietary source code and internal system documentation that is the exclusive intellectual property of Sinar Mas Land. I am authorized to act on behalf of Sinar Mas Land to request the removal of this infringing material.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The copyrighted work is the "Sinar Mas Land Progress Tracking System," a proprietary internal software application developed for and owned by Sinar Mas Land.

The repository iyanrinri/sinarmasland-progress-tracking infringes on this copyright by reproducing the source code, directory structure, and software architecture of this internal system without authorization. Specifically:

Unauthorized Source Code: The repository hosts a "Monorepo" implementation (frontend/backend) explicitly labeled "Sinar Mas Land Progress Tracking," which mimics the proprietary logic and workflow of the original private system.

Internal Architecture Exposure: The repository exposes specific internal technical configurations, including the apps/web (Nuxt.js) and apps/api (NestJS) directory structures, database schemas ([private]), and containerization logic ([private] configurations), which are confidential intellectual property.

Impersonation and Risk: By using the trademarked name "Sinar Mas Land" and mirroring our internal architecture, this repository creates a malicious impersonation of our official infrastructure. This unauthorized copy facilitates reconnaissance against Sinar Mas Land's production environment by exposing the exact technical stack and port configurations (e.g., 5432, 5050) used internally.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

The original work is a strictly confidential, non-public internal software system used within Sinar Mas Land's private infrastructure and is not accessible to the public internet. The intellectual property rights belong to the corporate entity: https://www.sinarmasland.com
