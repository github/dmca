**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and sole copyright holder of the browser extension “uSwitch: Reddit Accounts,” created and published under the name [private]. [private] own the source code and all associated files and license the project under the terms defined in the LICENSE.md file included in the original repository.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work is “uSwitch: Reddit Accounts,” a browser extension that allows users to manage and switch between multiple Reddit accounts. The project consists of original source code, configuration files, and extension metadata (including manifest.json), authored by [private] and distributed via GitHub, the Chrome Web Store, and Firefox Add-ons.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

other

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The project is licensed under a custom license defined in LICENSE.md that requires the original author ([private]) to remain credited. The forked repository modifies the core extension file manifest.json to replace or add the fork author’s name, removing the required attribution to the original author. This constitutes a direct violation of the license terms.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

The LICENSE.md explicitly requires prior permission before any modification or redistribution that alters authorship. No permission was requested or granted by the operator of the forked repository published by user ruinmi, and there was no response after more than seven days of attempted contact. As permission was never given, the forked repository cannot be brought into compliance. The only appropriate resolution is removal of the infringing repository.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

Yes. I attempted to contact the operator of the forked repository via email, but received no response after more than seven days.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
