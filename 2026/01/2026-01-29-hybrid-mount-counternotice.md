**Are you the owner of the content that has been disabled, or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf?**

Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I believe this takedown is based on a misidentification or mistake, as the claimant appears to be referencing the old repository that [private] already deleted. The current repository contains none of their code.  
I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located, and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the original DMCA notification or an agent of such person.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

The current repository contains entirely original code written by [private]. Specifically:

All binary/backend code has been completely rewritten in C++ by [private] (the original was in Rust)  
The WebUI has been completely rewritten in TypeScript by [private] (the previous WebUI, which [private] had already deleted, was forked code)

The previous repository incident:

[private] initially forked a repository that contained Rust binaries and a WebUI  
The WebUI itself was forked by the claimant from another third party  
After a previous DMCA complaint regarding attribution, [private] voluntarily deleted that entire repository  
[private] discarded all previous WebUI code completely

The current repository:

Contains zero lines of code from the claimant or any third party  
Is entirely [private] original work, written from scratch  
The DMCA claim appears to be based on the previous repository situation, not the current codebase

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**
