**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] [private] and copyright owner of a paid Chrome extension called “CanvasHack.” All source code used in this extension, including its JavaScript files such as background.js, inject.js, content.js, and internal logic files, was written by [private] and is [private] exclusive intellectual property.

The infringing repository folder listed below contains exact copies of [private] paid, proprietary source code, which has been cracked and redistributed without permission. Users normally must purchase the extension to access its code or features, and the unauthorized distribution harms [private] business and violates my exclusive rights.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The copyrighted work is [private] paid Chrome extension “CanvasHack,” which contains original JavaScript code, custom logic, UI components, authentication systems, and specialized features designed for the Canvas LMS. The original code is only available through [private] official Chrome Web Store listing and is protected by technological access controls.

My extension code is not open source, is not publicly distributed, and has never been licensed for reuse.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

CanvasHack includes paywall and authentication systems that validate paid users before allowing access to premium features. These checks occur through server-side verification and licensing logic. Without successful authentication, users cannot access the functionality contained in [private] code.

The infringing project bypasses and disables these checks, providing cracked access to paid content and circumventing [private] protection measures.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The infringing repository distributes a cracked version of [private] extension in which the license validation and authentication systems have been removed. This allows unauthorized users to access [private] paid features and source code without purchasing the extension.

This is a direct circumvention of [private] technological protection measures and a violation of 17 U.S.C. §1201 (anti-circumvention).

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
