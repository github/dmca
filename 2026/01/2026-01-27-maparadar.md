Proof of Ownership:  
- Domain Ownership: I am the [private] of maparadar.com.br. Verification can be found via [private]: [private]. The international maparadar.com domain [private] has private info, but I can provide screenshots if needed.  
  
- Historical Records: A snapshot of the original official Play Store listing can be found on Web Archive: [private]

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**  
  
The original copyrighted work is a proprietary mobile application named "MapaRadar Mobile" (Package ID: br.com.mobilemasters.maparadar).  
  
It is a specialized navigation and safety software developed for the Android platform. The application’s primary function is to provide real-time alerts and geolocation services to drivers regarding speed cameras, traffic hazards, and road safety information across Brazil.  
  
The copyrighted material includes, but is not limited to:  
  
- Source Code: The entire architecture, logic, and implementation were written in Java.  
- User Interface (UI): The unique visual design, layout, and custom assets used within the app.  
- Proprietary Logic: Custom algorithms for GPS data processing, alert triggering, and database synchronization.  
- API Integration: The specific methodology and private credentials used to communicate with MapaRadar's backend services and third-party map providers.  
  
The software was officially distributed as a compiled, obfuscated Android Package (APK) via the Google Play Store. The source code has never been released under any open-source license or made public by the owner. The repository in question contains a decompiled version of this binary, exposing private source code and internal secrets that are protected under international copyright treaties and Brazilian Software Law (Law No. 9.609/98).  
  
The user has performed unauthorized reverse engineering (decompilation) of the MapaRadar Mobile APK. This is a direct violation of our End User License Agreement (EULA), specifically:  
  
- Clause 2(C): Explicitly prohibits reverse engineering, decompilation, and disassembly.  
  
- Clause 4: Confirms that all intellectual property rights belong exclusively to MapaRadar.  
  
The repository publicly exposes proprietary source code and, more critically, two private API keys extracted from the binary, which poses an immediate security and financial risk to our operations.

Additional Context: The software is currently in a legacy state and was unlisted from the Google Play Store due to recent Android API compatibility requirements. However, the intellectual property remains private and protected, and the source code is maintained in a private [private] repository.  
  
EULA is embedded in the APK with no public location. Only during the software installation is the user prompted with terms and conditions that they agree to.  
  
Although, EULA is available at reversed engineered version: https://github.com/wilkertoigo/mapa-radar-re/blob/a7fb8c36ddb55a22b60c12b673205db8bf68290a/res/raw/eula
