I am the [private] and copyright owner of the code files in my private fork repository ([private]). [private] created these files [private] and have full copyright ownership over this original work.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The copyrighted work consists of private code files and configurations that [private] authored in [private] private fork repository ([private]). These files were accidentally exposed when [private] mistakenly created Pull Request #133 from [private] private fork to the public upstream repository HKUDS/AI-Trader.
