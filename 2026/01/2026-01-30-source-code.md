**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] [private] and copyright holder of the source code found in the repository https://github.com/xhyrom/www. [private] project is a [private] website built using the Astro framework and licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0).

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original work is the complete source code and compiled output of [private] [private] portfolio website, available at: https://github.com/xhyrom/www and [private]. It features a unique frontend architecture built with Astro and TailwindCSS.

The copyrighted work includes highly specific and original implementations that are clearly visible in the compiled output, such as:  
- A specific JSON-LD schema (application/ld+json) structure used for SEO data.  
- An identical HTML DOM structure and nesting (e.g., <header>, <nav>, <ul>, <li> layouts).  
- Unique combinations of TailwindCSS utility classes for specific hover effects and transitions.  
- Custom UI logic, such as the exact ARIA labels and structure for the mobile hamburger menu.  
- The copyright extends to the source code, the unique design implementation, and the exact compiled HTML/CSS artifacts generated from this source.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

Specific files within the repository are infringing

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

gnu-affero-general-public-license-v3.0

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The infringing repository (https://github.com/mrFavoslav/favoslav.cz) contains a derivative work based on the compiled/built output (HTML/CSS) of [private]  original source code. The infringing user took the static build artifacts of [private] website, performed minor modifications (changing text, images, and color hex codes), and republished it. The HTML DOM structure and CSS utility class logic remain substantially identical to [private] original work.

This constitutes a violation of the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0) in two key ways:  
- Relicensing: The infringer has distributed a derivative work under the MIT License. The AGPL-3.0 constitutes a "copyleft" license, requiring that any derivative works must also be licensed under AGPL-3.0 (Section 5c).  
- Failure to provide Source Code: The AGPL-3.0 requires that when distributing the work (even as object code/compiled HTML), the "Corresponding Source" must be made available (Section 6). The infringing repository only contains the compiled build artifacts (HTML/CSS) and does not provide the underlying source code (Astro components, configuration files) used to generate them.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

To comply with the AGPL-3.0 license, the user must:  
- Change the repository's license from MIT to AGPL-3.0 to match the original work.  
- Publish the complete "Corresponding Source" code for their modified version. Since they modified the output HTML directly, they would need to reconstruct and publish the underlying source code (Astro files) that corresponds to their specific modifications.  
- Retain [private] original copyright notices and provide proper attribution.

I have already attempted to contact the user regarding this violation, but they refused to comply with the license terms. Therefore, removing the infringing repository is the necessary course of action.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
