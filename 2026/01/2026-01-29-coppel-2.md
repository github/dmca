Hello GitHub Trust & Safety team,  
I am part of Accenture [private], authorized to act on behalf of Coppel S.A. de C.V. for copyright enforcement, brand protection, and intellectual property matters.  
I am submitting a DMCA takedown notice concerning the unauthorized use of copyrighted and trademark‑protected Coppel brand assets in this repository.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**  
  
1) Copyright Ownership  
Coppel S.A. de C.V. holds exclusive rights over:  
  
the official Coppel corporate logo and wordmark,  
brand identity graphical assets,  
raster and vector renderings of the mark (PNG, JPG, SVG, WEBP, ICO),  
all stylized, derivative, or mirrored versions of the logo.  
  
These works are protected under Mexican and international IP law.  
  
Trademark registration (IMPI): https://marcia.impi.gob.mx/marcas/search/details/RM202403127110  
Official website: https://www.coppel.com  
  
2) Description of the Infringement  
The repository includes multiple unlicensed reproductions of the official Coppel logo as Android application assets:  
Infringing files (examples):  
  
https://github.com/MaelEdevane/CoppelAyuda/blob/main/CoppelAyuda%20-%20copia/app/src/main/logo-playstore.png  
https://github.com/MaelEdevane/CoppelAyuda/blob/main/CoppelAyuda%20-%20copia/app/src/main/logomk2-playstore.png  
  
These assets:  
  
display the full, unaltered Coppel logo,  
are embedded in app/src/main/ (production UI resources),  
are named and structured for app store branding (e.g., logo-playstore.png),  
are publicly redistributed without authorization or license,  
create an unintended association or endorsement between Coppel and this application.  
  
This is not fair use: the logos are not used for commentary, criticism, or educational transformation; they serve as application branding.  
  
3) Infringing Repository  
Repository URL:  
https://github.com/MaelEdevane/CoppelAyuda  
Given that the infringing assets are packaged as application resources within a public repository, removal of the infringing files—or the repository if required—is necessary under the DMCA.

https://www.coppel.com

Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**
