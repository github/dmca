**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

We, SOCRadar, are the authorized Digital Risk Protection vendor and designated representative acting on behalf of the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MOHRE) of the United Arab Emirates.

The copyrighted material in question is the "MOHRE Document Processing Pipeline," a proprietary, closed-source software suite owned exclusively by MOHRE. This software includes backend source code, internal validation algorithms, workflow logic, and technical documentation created for the Ministry’s internal government operations. This code is confidential, has never been released under an open-source license, and is strictly protected by copyright. The repository owner has no authorization, license, or permission to host, publish, or distribute this proprietary code.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work is the private source code for the "MOHRE Document Processing Pipeline." This is an internal, non-public software system hosted on the Ministry's private servers. It is used for automating the validation of official government documents, processing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) data, and verifying Emirates IDs. Because this is internal backend software, there is no public URL for the source code; however, the software supports the services found at the official Ministry URL provided.

We assert that the entire repository (https://github.com/rt-uae-dev/MOHRE_AI) is infringing and constitutes an unauthorized full-scale reproduction of the Ministry’s private codebase. The repository contains the exact proprietary directory structure, business logic, and internal naming conventions of the original work.

The infringement is total, but it is specifically proven by the following elements found within the repository:

Explicit Title and Scope: The README.md file identifies the project as the "MOHRE Document Processing Pipeline," matching the exact name of our private internal software.

Proprietary Business Logic: The code exposes internal validation rules unique to MOHRE. Specifically, the "Attestation Number Validation" logic (referenced in the repository documentation and code) utilizes a proprietary algorithm for rejecting specific number formats and filtering Emirates IDs. This logic is not generic; it is specific to UAE government processing rules.

Internal File Structure: The repository reproduces our private directory structure, specifically the modules named [private] and [private]. These are non-standard, internal naming conventions used by the Ministry's development team.

Exposure of Internal Test Data: The repository includes hardcoded references to private internal testing data, specifically filenames described as "Akif's case simulation" and "Ahmad's certificate." These references correspond to internal Ministry developers and test cases, proving this is a direct leak of the private development environment.

As this repository is a direct clone of confidential government software, we request the immediate removal of the entire repository.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

https://www.mohre.gov.ae (Note to GitHub: The original work is proprietary, closed-source backend code stored on private internal servers. It is not publicly accessible. The URL provided is the official website of the rights holder, the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation.)

Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**
