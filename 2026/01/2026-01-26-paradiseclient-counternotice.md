**Are you the owner of the content that has been disabled, or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf?**

Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and copyright holder of a substantial portion of the disabled repository, including original source code, rendering systems, and UI/theme components that [private] [private] developed and committed to the project.

[private] contributions are documented in the GitHub commit history and contributor logs under [private] GitHub account (Zalgo-Dev). These contributions were made with the explicit knowledge and authorization of the original project owner during an active collaboration period.

The takedown notice incorrectly claims ownership over the entire repository, including code that [private] [private] authored and retain rights to.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/Zalgo-Dev/ParadiseClient-Fabric

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

The DMCA notice is the result of a contractual and financial dispute following the termination of a collaboration, not a copyright infringement.

The complaining party previously authorized [private] contributions and has since incorporated [private] work into their own repository. The notice attempts to retroactively claim exclusive ownership over code [private] authored, which constitutes a misidentification under the DMCA.

Additionally, the dispute concerns payments, infrastructure management, and project control, as evidenced by internal communications, and not unauthorized copying or distribution of copyrighted material.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**

**Please confirm that you have you have read our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Counter Notice</a>.**

**So that the complaining party can get back to you, please provide both your telephone number and physical address.**
