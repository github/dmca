**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

The repository contains confidential coding tasks and technical assessments developed internally by JobLeads GmbH for use in our candidate evaluation process. This code is original creative work owned solely byJobLeads GmbH and is not open source. I am employed as [private] of [private] at JobLeads GmbH and have been authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner to protect these proprietary assets.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original work consists of a collection of proprietary technical assessment tasks and coding challenges created by JobLeads GmbH for our internal recruitment process (specifically for Fullstack Position candidates).  
The copyrighted material includes:  
1. Custom source code, problem statements, and unit tests located in folders named 'Admin', 'Development', 'Frontend', and 'Refactoring'.  
2. Specific instructions and documentation (README files) guiding candidates through the 'Trial Day' assessment.  
3. Proprietary solution scaffolding and logic meant to test candidate skills in PHP, Vue.js, and other technologies.  
This material is not open source; it is strictly confidential business property used solely for evaluating job applicants. The repository in question (h3nnry/jobleads-trialday) reproduces this entire directory structure and its contents verbatim without our authorization.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/h3nnry/jobleads-trialday

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The original work is hosted in a [private] [private] repository that is not publicly accessible or indexed by search engines.  
We utilize the following strict access controls:  
1. Employee Access: Full access is restricted to authorized employees via secure authentication.  
2. Candidate Access: External candidates are granted temporary, invitation-only access to a forked version of the repository. This access is strictly limited to the duration of the assessment window.  
3. Revocation: Once the assessment is complete, the candidate's access credentials are immediately revoked.  
The unauthorized publication on GitHub bypasses these restrictions and violates the confidentiality agreement inherent in the private access grant.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project circumvents our protection measures by creating an unauthorized, public mirror of content that is otherwise only available behind a secure authentication gate.  
1. Exfiltration: The repository owner used their temporary, restricted credentials to clone the proprietary code from our private [private] environment.  
2. Bypassing Authentication: By pushing this code to a public GitHub repository, the accused project effectively strips away the mandatory authentication (username/password) and authorization checks required to view the original work.  
The GitHub repository allows the general public to access, download, and use our proprietary recruitment assets without the authorization or credentials strictly enforced on the original platform.
