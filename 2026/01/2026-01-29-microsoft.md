If you use a personal email address for a notice submitted on behalf of a company, we may not be able to process it.**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

[private] on PlayReady [private] [private].

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The hosted materials are part of our PlayReady product and allow bad actors to pirate PlayReady protected content.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Microsoft PlayReady is built upon a sophisticated, multi-layered digital rights management framework that employs proprietary cryptographic techniques and controlled distribution channels. Key technical measures include:

• Secure Key and Certificate Distribution: PlayReady secrets—including Group Keys and device-specific certificates—are generated within and protected by secure hardware and software ecosystems. They are disseminated exclusively to authorized partners through legally binding licensing agreements, ensuring that only entities that have met strict compliance and security standards can access the protected material.

• Encryption and Authentication: Our DRM framework uses industry-leading encryption protocols and secure authentication mechanisms. This prevents unauthorized entities from reconstructing valid licenses or decrypting protected content. Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) and secure key storage further mitigate risks by safeguarding critical cryptographic ingredients against extraction or tampering.

• Policy Enforcement and Integrity Checks: PlayReady incorporates runtime integrity verification and secure challenge–response protocols. These measures validate that the operational environment is authentic and has not been compromised or reverse-engineered. Our robust revocation mechanisms ensure that any unauthorized use or distribution of cryptographic material can be curtailed quickly through certificate revocation and system updates.

Collectively, these measures create a closed ecosystem where access to our proprietary secrets is tightly controlled and monitored, ensuring that only authorized operations under valid licensing agreements are permitted.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused GitHub repositories are engineered in a manner that subverts the core technological protections embedded in PlayReady:

• Reverse-Engineering of Proprietary Components: The project explicitly builds upon the “mspr_toolkit” – a tool that was originally designed under controlled conditions. By reverse-engineering, manipulating, and repackaging parts of this tool, the project provides users with instructions and code to recreate functionality that replicates sensitive aspects of our DRM ecosystem.

• Extraction and Reconstruction Methods: The project contains functionality and guidance aimed at extracting and reconstructing keys or certificates from sources that should be controlled. For instance, it describes methods to retrieve cryptographic elements from legacy devices or encrypted firmware binaries—actions that directly circumvent our secure key distribution and licensing processes.

• Bypassing Secure Licensing Protocols: By distributing code that directly shares “PlayReady Device (.prd)” files for existing devices or enables users to generate “PlayReady Device (.prd)” files outside of our authorized system, the project undermines the exclusive process of device provisioning and license issuance. This bypass effectively negates the integrity checks and cryptographic protections that we have employed to enforce usage under a valid licensing regime.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**
