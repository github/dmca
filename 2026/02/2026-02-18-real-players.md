Hello GitHub Trust & Safety,  
  
Thank you for the opportunity to clarify. I am submitting this revised notice to correct the URL error and clarify the license status of [private] work.  
  
Correction of Repository URLs  
In [private] previous submission, I accidentally pasted the infringing link in the "Original Work" field. Please verify the correct URLs below:  
Location of the Original Copyrighted Work ([private] Repo):  
https://github.com/AjaxFNC-YT/Fortnite-Real-Players  
  
Location of the Infringing Material (Thief's Repo):  
https://github.com/undefined-name12/jugadores-reales-fortnite  
  
Clarification of "Open Source" Status  
In [private] previous description, I used the term "open-source" colloquially to mean "publicly visible." However, I must clarify: [private] repository is NOT licensed under an open-source license (such as MIT, GPL, etc.) that would permit this user to redistribute [private] work. [private] retain full copyright ownership. The user undefined-name12 has copied [private] code without [private] authorization, translated the name, and falsely inserted their own license file claiming they created and own the software.  
  
Revised Description of Infringement  
The user undefined-name12 has created an unauthorized derivative of [private] project "Fortnite-Real-Players." They copied the entire repository and renamed it "jugadores-reales-fortnite." Proof of this theft is located in the file realppl.py within the infringing repository, where the user failed to remove [private] original credit line "Made by AjaxFNC-YT," despite falsely claiming in their added license file that they are the sole owner.  
  
Required Statements  
I confirm the following:  
  
I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.  
  
I have taken fair use into consideration.  
  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.  
  
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.
