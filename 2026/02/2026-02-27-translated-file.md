I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I am the [private] of the translation. [private] made 100% of it [private] by hand translating each line of original text in notepad so that the game may be run in polish language. [private] had manually adjusted in-game fonts so that they display diacritic marks and accents some of the files use a .json structure, others are in plain .txt. As it is stated the translation as a whole is [private] own work that hasn't been done before by anyone else. This person stole [private] work, and expunged any files or mentions of [private] name therefor forced [private] to take matters in [private] own hands.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

Translated game files with varied structure. Some are simple numbered text lines varying in length, but all of them are translated and consistently updated by [private] on steam workshop - the only authorized place. [private] manually edited in game fonts to support polish diacritic letters like "ą,ć,ę,ń,ł,ó,ś,ź,ż" which are most of the time never supported by fonts therefore the low quality solutions are removing and replacing them with counterparts without accents. It took a lot of time and effort from [private] as well as a feedback from community to keep the translation useful for the niche community. [private] had full support and help from the developers as well as mutual cooperation in making the translation even possible as some things used to be hardcoded. [private] have all of the original files accesible with data and each iteration proving that I am the [private] that got removed from any form of credits. The only thing that the person uploading this Github repo did was 124 small changes which he could suggested through steam instead of breaking the clause in the description of the website to not copy and publish it without [private] consent.  
I can provide screenshots, zip files with the source material with the original date of publishing.
