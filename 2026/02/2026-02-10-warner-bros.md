Dear Abuse Manager,


I, the undersigned, CERTIFY UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY that I am the owner of, or an agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner of, certain intellectual property rights, said owner being Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.  and its subsidiaries and affiliates, including Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. (collectively, “IP Owner”).


IP Owner is the owner of copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights in and to the Tom and Jerry series of motion pictures, comic books, and all names, characters, images, and related indicia, with respect to a wide variety of goods and services (the “Tom and Jerry Works”).  Because of these rights, no one is authorized to reproduce, manufacture, transmit, copy, distribute, advertise, offer for sale, sell or otherwise utilize IP Owner’s intellectual property rights or to create derivative works, without the express written permission of IP Owner.


I have a good faith belief that the materials identified below are not authorized by IP Owner, its agent, or the law, and therefore infringe IP Owner's rights in the Tom and Jerry Works.  Please act expeditiously to remove and/or disable access to the material or items claimed to be infringing.


I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate.


Please confirm that you have taken appropriate action in compliance with this notice at your earliest convenience.  Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter and please advise should you have any questions or require any additional information.


This letter is not a complete statement of IP Owner’s rights in connection with this matter and nothing contained herein constitutes an express or implied waiver of any rights, remedies or defenses of IP Owner in connection therewith, all of which are expressly reserved.
