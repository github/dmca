The MIT License is a permissive, non-revocable open-source license that allows for modification and redistribution.

The copyright holder has publicly admitted to these facts. In the comments section of their [private] model page ([private]), the author (user "@[private]") stated on 2025-02-05: "The only community use of the earlier MIT release I could find was a clone of this tool... That was not what I had in mind when I released the code with the MIT license."

This admission confirms the code was validly released under the MIT License. While the author may have changed the license for subsequent versions, they cannot retroactively revoke the MIT License for the version [private] am using. [private] use is fully authorized by the license granted at the time of the original release.
