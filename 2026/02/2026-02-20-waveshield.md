Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] [private] holder of the source code in question, as it was originally created by [private]. The code was developed and maintained in [private] [private] [private] repository, and I did not authorize any third party to upload or distribute it without my permission.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work consists of a custom FiveM anti-cheat software solution that [private] developed and sell through [private] website [private]  
. This software is specifically designed to protect FiveM servers from cheating by detecting and blocking malicious activities.

While [private] sell access to the software, the actual source code is obfuscated and protected to prevent unauthorized access or modification. [private] customers only receive a protected, obfuscated version of the code, ensuring that the original source code is not exposed. This software is sold to paying customers under strict terms of use, and the distribution is controlled exclusively through my website.

The repository containing the source code was private and secured until my GitHub token was stolen due to a CVE vulnerability. The stolen, unprotected code was then uploaded to an unauthorized repository, violating my copyright. This unauthorized upload constitutes a clear infringement, as it exposes the protected code, which was not meant for public distribution.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

https://waveshield.xyz  
[private] ([private] repo)

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/aspirinoo/FiveM-Anticheat-WSV4

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

[private] have implemented several technological measures to protect [private] copyrighted FiveM anti-cheat software and control access to it:

1. Obfuscation and Protection: The source code provided to customers is obfuscated to prevent reverse engineering, making it significantly more difficult for unauthorized users to access or modify the original code. The obfuscation also protects the intellectual property embedded within the software, ensuring that the original code remains secure.

2. Encrypted Licensing System: [private] software is tied to a licensing system that ensures only authorized customers can use it. The system verifies the license key during installation and runtime, making it impossible for unauthorized individuals to access or use the software without a valid license.

3. Restricted Distribution: The software is sold only to paying customers via [private] website, waveshield.xyz
, and it is delivered in a protected format that cannot be directly modified or redistributed. Customers do not receive the original source code, ensuring that only the obfuscated version is in circulation.

4. Terms of Service and End User License Agreement (EULA): All customers must agree to [private] terms of service and EULA before purchasing or using the software. These agreements prohibit unauthorized redistribution of the software and its underlying code.

These measures are designed to protect the integrity of my software and ensure that it is only accessed by legitimate users. Despite these protections, my GitHub token was stolen, and my source code was unlawfully exposed and uploaded to an unauthorized repository.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The infringing project was able to circumvent [private] technological protection measures through the theft of [private] [private] token, which allowed unauthorized access to [private] private, secured repository. The token theft, due to a React vulnerability (CVE), granted the attackers the ability to access the unprotected, original version of the source code, bypassing the obfuscation and licensing measures in place for the distributed software.

The attackers then uploaded the original, unprotected source code to an unauthorized GitHub repository. While [private] customers receive an obfuscated and protected version of the software, the stolen code is not obfuscated and thus exposes [private] intellectual property. By gaining access to the raw, unprotected source code, the attackers bypassed the obfuscation and licensing systems designed to prevent unauthorized access and distribution.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No, the work is not licensed under an open-source license. The FiveM anti-cheat software is a proprietary product that [private] sell through [private] website, waveshield.xyz  
. The software is distributed to paying customers in a protected, obfuscated form, and the original source code is not made available for public use or modification.
