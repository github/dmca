Dear GitHub Copyright Team,  
  
   
  
I am submitting this notice under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) on behalf of Key Games Network BV, a subsidiary of Azerion Group NV (“Azerion”), the copyright owner identified below. I am authorized to act on behalf of Azerion in relation to the enforcement of its intellectual property rights.  
  
   
  
Identification of the copyrighted work  
The copyrighted works are a number of proprietary video games owned by Azerion. These games are original copyrighted works consisting of software code, audiovisual elements, game design, artwork, sound, and related assets developed and owned by Azerion and/or its affiliated studios. These games are commercial products and are not authorized for public distribution, copying, or modification outside Azerion’s approved publishing and distribution channels. Many of these games also incorporate Azerion’s proprietary “Azerion SDK” (https://gamedistribution.com/developers/quality-guidelines/), which serves as the mandatory technical link between the games and Azerion’s advertising infrastructure. The inclusion of Azerion SDK further confirms that the distributed builds originate from Azerion’s protected game versions.  
  
   
  
Authorized versions of these games are available only through Azerion’s official platforms and licensed distribution partners, including:
