**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and [private] of the repository "la_land_wholesale." The original repository is hosted at [private] under [private] GitHub account ([private]). [private] created this codebase and all original code was authored by [private] and [private] AI coding assistant. The commit history confirms [private] authorship throughout the entire project.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work is a proprietary land wholesaling platform called "la_land_wholesale," a full-stack application built with Python (FastAPI backend) and TypeScript (frontend). The repository contains custom business logic, API integrations, data processing scripts, deployment configurations, and frontend code. The original repository is located at: [private]. It contains 69 commits, all authored by [private] ([private]) and [private] AI coding assistant (claude). This is proprietary commercial software that [private] developed for [private] business. The repository was unintentionally left with public visibility, and the infringing user (justinseger015-ctrl) forked it during that window without [private] knowledge or authorization. [private] have since corrected the visibility settings on [private] original repository. At no point was this code licensed, shared, or authorized for redistribution by any third party.
