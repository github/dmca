**Are you the owner of the content that has been disabled, or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf?**

Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am engaged in custom development and have added [private] [private] to code to open source licensed code.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/Nothankyou111/ProtoPirate

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

This is abuse of the dmca process. There is no copyright involved or owned by the person who filed this false notice. Once again this is a fraudulent dmca notice. No code is shown on the page cited by the dmca notice. A development project that may or may not have similar goals and/or purpose to a webpage (with no source code) cannot be infringing on it's face. Is open office a violation of [private] [private] just because they both can edit text? This code is not firmware code therefore it can't be infringing whatever firmware the person that filed this notice is supposedly selling.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**

**Please confirm that you have you have read our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Counter Notice</a>.**

**So that the complaining party can get back to you, please provide both your telephone number and physical address.**
