Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] [private] and [private] copyright holder of the source code in question. [private] created the code [private] and it was developed and maintained in [private] [private] repository. I have not granted any license or authorization for any third party to upload, reproduce, distribute, or publicly share this code without my express permission.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work consists of a custom FiveM anti-cheat software solution that [private] developed and sell through [private] website https://waveshield.xyz

The software is designed to protect FiveM servers from cheating and malicious activity by detecting, preventing, and blocking unauthorized modifications, exploits, and abusive behavior within the server environment. The system includes proprietary source code, detection logic, server-side protections, and supporting components that were independently developed by [private].

Access to the software is sold exclusively through [private] official website. Customers are provided only with a compiled and obfuscated version of the software. The original source code is not distributed to customers and is intentionally protected to prevent unauthorized access, copying, reverse engineering, or modification. Distribution is strictly controlled and subject to specific terms of use.

The complete source code was maintained in a [private] [private] and was not publicly accessible. Due to a CVE vulnerability, [private] GitHub token was stolen, the [private] [private] was compromised and the unprotected source code was unlawfully obtained. The stolen source code was subsequently uploaded to a public repository without my authorization.

This unauthorized publication exposes proprietary source code that was never intended for public distribution and constitutes clear copyright infringement.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

[private] have implemented several technological measures to protect the copyrighted FiveM anti-cheat software and control access to it:

Obfuscation and Protection: The source code provided to customers is obfuscated to prevent reverse engineering, making it significantly more difficult for unauthorized users to access or modify the original code. The obfuscation also protects the intellectual property embedded within the software, ensuring that the original code remains secure.

Encrypted Licensing System: WaveShield software is tied to a licensing system that ensures only authorized customers can use it. The system verifies the license key during installation and runtime, making it impossible for unauthorized individuals to access or use the software without a valid license.

Restricted Distribution: The software is sold only to paying customers via our website, waveshield.xyz , and it is delivered in a protected format that cannot be directly modified or redistributed. Customers do not receive the original source code, ensuring that only the obfuscated version is in circulation.

Terms of Service and End User License Agreement (EULA): All customers must agree to [private] terms of service and EULA before purchasing or using the software. These agreements prohibit unauthorized redistribution of the software and its underlying code.

These measures are designed to protect the integrity of [private] software and ensure that it is only accessed by legitimate users. Despite these protections, [private] [private] token was stolen, and [private] source code was unlawfully exposed and uploaded to an unauthorized repository.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project was able to circumvent my technological protection measures through the unauthorized acquisition and misuse of a compromised access token, which provided unlawful access to [private] [private] and secured source code repository.

The original source code was stored in a [private] [private] and was not publicly accessible. Access was restricted through authentication controls and repository privacy settings. Additionally, the commercially distributed version of the software is compiled and obfuscated to prevent access to the underlying source code and to enforce licensing restrictions.

As a result of the compromised access credentials, the attackers were able to access the [private] [private] and obtain the original, unobfuscated source code. This bypassed the technological protection measures in place, including repository access controls, obfuscation mechanisms, and licensing safeguards designed to prevent unauthorized access, copying, and redistribution.

The attackers subsequently uploaded the original, unprotected source code to a public GitHub repository without authorization. The publicly distributed version exposes proprietary source code that was never intended for public release and directly undermines the protective measures implemented to safeguard the work.

This unauthorized access and publication constitute both copyright infringement and circumvention of technological protection measures.
