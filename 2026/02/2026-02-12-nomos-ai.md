Dear GitHub DMCA Agent:  
I am an authorized representative of Nomos AI, Inc., d/b/a Norm Ai (“Norm Ai”). This letter
constitutes notice under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512) requesting that
GitHub remove or disable access to infringing material hosted on GitHub.
 
1. Copyrighted Work Claimed To Be Infringed:
 
The copyrighted work is Norm Ai’s original employment take-home assignment and associated
materials provided to candidates/employees for evaluation and onboarding purposes (the “Work”),
including original text, prompts, and any accompanying reference materials or proprietary solution
elements.
 
Work identifier/title (internal): Norm Ai Full-Stack Take-Home Project / Full Stack Engineer
Exercise  
Approx. creation date / first internal distribution: January 2024
Copyright owner: Nomos AI, Inc., d/b/a Norm Ai
 
2. Infringing Material And Location (URLs):
 
The infringing material appears at the following GitHub URL(s):
 
Repository: https://github.com/andresdev9943/norm-takehome-fullstack
File(s):  
• https://github.com/andresdev9943/norm-takehomefullstack/blob/main/New%20Full-Stack%20Engineer%20Exercise%20-
%20Norm%20Ai.pdf (Primary confidential work document - 3-page proprietary
employee take-home exercise)
 
Infringement Explanation. This file is a verbatim copy of the Work (Norm Ai Full-Stack
Take-Home Project / Full Stack Engineer Exercise).
 
• https://github.com/andresdev9943/norm-takehomefullstack/blob/main/README.md (Contains references to and excerpts from the
proprietary employee exercise)
 
Infringement Explanation. This file contains verbatim excerpts and/or close paraphrases
from the Work.
 
Commit(s)/release(s) (if applicable):  
• https://github.com/andresdev9943/norm-takehomefullstack/commit/5528c12b360345d00f83ce5623d222b217fd17cd (Commit where the
PDF was added: "feat: update the project documentation", committed Nov 19, 2025)
 
• Entire repository history: https://github.com/andresdev9943/norm-takehomefullstack/commits/main
 
For clarity, Norm Ai’s claim is directed only to the Norm Ai-authored employee take-home
assignment materials (and verbatim excerpts thereof) identified above. To the extent the
Repository also contains the user’s independently created implementation/code, Norm Ai does not
claim ownership of that independently created work and is not requesting removal of noninfringing material. However, the sole purpose of the repository is distribution of the Work; the
repository is predominantly composed of the Work and derivative copies, and the remaining
contents are insubstantial/ancillary.
 
The material was posted by a Norm Ai employee who worked at Norm Ai for 36 hours, without
authorization, and in breach of confidentiality and IP obligations.
 
3. Good Faith Belief:
 
I have a good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted material described above is not authorized
by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
 
4. Accuracy And Authority Statement (Under Penalty Of Perjury):
 
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notice is accurate and that I am the
copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.
 
5. Requested Action:
 
Please remove or disable access to the infringing material identified in Section 2 - specifically the
Norm Ai-authored PDF take-home assignment and any verbatim copies/excerpts of that Work
(including in README.md, if it contains such excerpts), and any identical copies of those files in
the Repository’s git history. Norm Ai is not requesting removal of the user’s independently created
implementation code except to the extent it contains verbatim copies of the Work.
