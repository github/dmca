Famobi GmbH is the web HTML5 game developer and publisher. We develop our own and publish mobile game titles on the variety of websites and on other platforms. Yesterday we were notified by our Google partners that they encountered a couple of our builds in the free access on GitHub that we never autorised. Today we did an investigation and found out an account (https://github.com/ahrdevelopers) spreading out 3500+ JS/HTML game build repositories as open-source.  
  
We have encountered at least 15 titles of our own in this "catalogue" (We predict it is much more, they can be easily identified by either famobi.json or famobi function calls in any index.html inside the game files.
