**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and copyright owner of AlecaFrame and its associated proprietary source code and assets (including paid content) first published/released on [04/2022]. The work was developed by [private] ([private]), and all rights are reserved.

I have read and understand GitHub’s Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The copyrighted work is the proprietary software application AlecaFrame (the “Software”), including:

The original source code implementing the Software (AlecaFrame backend libraries and web project).

Original non-code assets shipped with the Software (e.g., UI assets, icons, images, shaders, configuration data, documentation), including paid/locked content such as ‘premium feature modules’ and 'ad removal', and the selection, structure, and arrangement of these components.

The repository identified below contains a decompiled and reconstructed version of AlecaFrame, derived from [private] distributed binaries and/or packaged assets, and is being distributed publicly without authorization. It enables third parties to modify and use the Software and paid content without purchasing or complying with the license terms.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

The Software is available here:

Official website: https://alecaframe.com/  
Official download/store listing: https://www.overwolf.com/app/alejandro_cabrerizo-alecaframe  
Documentation/landing page describing the product: https://docs.alecaframe.com/

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Yes. Access to paid content and premium features in AlecaFrame is controlled by technological measures, including subscription status verification, server-side entitlement checks, and obfuscation.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The reported repository includes code and/or instructions designed to bypass these measures by unpacking the assets, decompiling the source code to make the necessary changes, and bypassing Overwolf's own anti-tampering signature verification, enabling unauthorized access to copyrighted paid content.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Repository can be made private

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
