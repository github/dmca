**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] [private] and copyright holder of the software project “vortex-js,” first published at https://github.com/SSL-ACTX/vortex-js.  
[private] own the copyright to the source code and documentation in this project and have not authorized its redistribution, relicensing, or distribution of executable binaries outside the terms of the AGPL-3.0 license.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work is the software project titled “vortex-js”, an AGPL-3.0 licensed JavaScript source-to-source compiler and virtual machine implementation.  
The project includes original source code, documentation, and project structure authored by [private] and first published at:
https://github.com/SSL-ACTX/vortex-js  
The copyrighted work covers the implementation of the compiler, virtual machine logic, build structure, and accompanying documentation and markdown files contained in that repository, all of which are licensed under AGPL-3.0 and owned by [private] as the original author.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

https://github.com/SSL-ACTX/vortex-js

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

gnu-affero-general-public-license-v3.0

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The project is licensed under AGPL-3.0, but the infringing repository redistributes derived material under an incorrect license (MIT) and omits the required AGPL-3.0 license text and original copyright notices.  
In addition, the infringing repository distributes an executable ZIP archive that [private] did not author and does not provide the complete corresponding source code for that binary, as required by AGPL-3.0.  
These actions violate the AGPL-3.0 license terms regarding license preservation, attribution, and source code availability.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

The project could be brought into compliance by relicensing the entire repository under AGPL-3.0, restoring the original copyright and license notices, and clearly attributing the original project and author.  
Any distributed binaries or ZIP archives must either be removed or accompanied by the complete corresponding source code and build instructions, as required by AGPL-3.0.   
Alternatively, the infringing material could be removed entirely.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

None

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
