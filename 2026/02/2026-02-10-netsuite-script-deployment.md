**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
I am the [private] and copyright holder of a proprietary Chrome extension titled “NetSuite Script Deployments”, published on the Chrome Web Store.  
  
The extension includes original source code, HTML, CSS, JavaScript logic, UI structure, and file organization developed by [private] and not released under any open-source license.  
  
The work was first published publicly via the Chrome Web Store prior to the infringing repository.  
Original work URL (your extension):  
https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/NetSuite%20Script%20Deployments/cdekfahggdghcemijijoolcohdobmbja  
  
Original source repository (Private Repo):  
[private]  
  
The original source code is maintained in a private repository under [private] control.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**  
  
The infringement includes verbatim copies of HTML and CSS files, identical UI structure, identical logic flow, and identical implementation details.  
  
Concrete examples include:  
  
• The file popup.html in the infringing repository is a verbatim copy of [private] original popup.html, including the <title> tag still referencing “NetSuite Script Deployments,” which is the name of [private] extension.  
  
• Multiple HTML blocks within popup.html are identical line-for-line between the two projects.  
  
• The file css/main.css contains numerous identical CSS blocks copied directly from [private] extension, including spinner animations, layout sizing, footer positioning, and typography rules.  
  
• The infringing repository presents this copied code as MIT-licensed open source, despite the fact that [private] original work was never released under any open-source license and remains proprietary.  
  
These similarities go well beyond general ideas or functionality and constitute direct copying of protected expression, structure, and implementation.  
  
**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**
