1. IDENTIFICATION OF COPYRIGHTED WORKS  
Divine Studio LLC is the creator and copyright owner of original custom skin assets for League of
Legends, distributed exclusively through Divine Skins (https://divineskins.gg) and our Celestial
Launcher. Our skins are original creative works involving custom 3D model modifications, original
texture artwork, visual effects, sound customizations, and UI/HUD designs.

2. IDENTIFICATION OF INFRINGING MATERIAL  
Infringing Repository:  
https://github.com/OphirMikhael/Celesti-hell  
Infringing Directory (400+ stolen skins):  
https://github.com/OphirMikhael/Celesti-hell/tree/main/skins/free  
Infringing Distribution Website:  
https://ophirmikhael.github.io/Celesti-hell.github.io/

3. DESCRIPTION OF INFRINGEMENT
The repository contains over 400 of our original skin creations copied without authorization.
Examples include: Angel series, Chibi series, Demon series, Death Raven series, Ghostly Raven
series, Metin2 series, Christmas series, Winterblessed series, Spirit Blossom modifications, custom
HUDs, BGM packs, recall animations, announcer packs, and hundreds more original creations.

4. FALSE DISCLAIMER / BAD FAITH  
The repository contains a deliberately misleading disclaimer: "All content here is fan-made, original,
or community-submitted — no copyrighted, official, or proprietary skins/assets are included."
This is demonstrably false. The content consists of our proprietary skin assets. This false disclaimer
constitutes bad faith, willful misrepresentation, and evidence of knowledge that the content is
proprietary. The name "Celesti-hell" is a deliberate corruption of our "Celestial" launcher brand.

5. LEGAL BASIS  
(a) Copyright Infringement (17 U.S.C. § 106): Mass reproduction and distribution without
authorization.  
(b) Willful Infringement (17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(2)): False disclaimer demonstrates intentional
disregard.  
(c) EU Copyright Violation: Articles 2, 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC; Article 17 of Directive 2019/790.

6. GOOD FAITH STATEMENT  
I have a good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted materials described above is not authorized
by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

7. STATEMENT UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of
the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

8. DEMANDED ACTION  
Pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c), we demand immediate removal of the entire repository, the
associated GitHub Pages website, and all forks. The repository exists solely to distribute our stolen
content, and the false disclaimer demonstrates bad faith.
