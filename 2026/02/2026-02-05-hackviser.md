1. Copyright Owner and Authorization  
I am authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner, Hackviser, a cybersecurity education and upskilling platform. Hackviser is the sole owner of the copyrighted materials described below. I am submitting this notice as an authorized representative of the copyright owner.

2. Description of the Original Copyrighted Work  
The copyrighted works include original cybersecurity training and certification materials created and owned by Hackviser, including but not limited to:

CAPT (Certified Application Penetration Tester) certification curriculum

Proprietary lab exercises, walkthroughs, scenarios, and challenge descriptions

Course documentation, structured learning paths, and instructional text

Internal certification methodology, task descriptions, and assessment materials

These materials were independently created by Hackviser and are not licensed under any open-source license. They are distributed only through Hackviser’s official platform under restricted access.

Official location of the original copyrighted works:

https://hackviser.com

[If available, add a direct URL such as: https://hackviser.com/certifications/capt]

3. Nature of the Infringement  
The GitHub repository identified below reproduces and distributes substantial portions of Hackviser’s proprietary CAPT certification content, including structured learning material, lab descriptions, and certification-related documentation.

This content was copied from Hackviser’s access-controlled platform and republished without authorization, outside of its intended environment. The material is made publicly available, enabling unrestricted access by third parties who have not purchased, subscribed to, or been granted permission to use the content.

This constitutes unauthorized reproduction and distribution of copyrighted material under applicable copyright law.

4. Infringing Material and URLs  
I am asserting that the entire repository is infringing, not limited to isolated excerpts.

Infringing repository:

https://github.com/Gabrielcamisadez/capt/

All files and directories within this repository reproduce or derive from Hackviser’s proprietary CAPT certification materials.

5. Technological Protection Measures  
Hackviser employs effective technological measures to control access to its copyrighted works, including:

Authenticated user accounts

Subscription-based access restrictions

Server-side authorization checks

Controlled content delivery mechanisms

The accused repository circumvents these protections by republishing protected materials outside the platform, effectively nullifying authentication, subscription, and authorization requirements.

6. Requested Action  
I respectfully request that GitHub remove or disable access to the infringing repository in its entirety.

7. Good-Faith and Accuracy Statements  
I have a good-faith belief that the use of the copyrighted materials described above is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

I have taken fair use into consideration and believe that the use does not qualify as fair use.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notice is accurate and that I am authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.
