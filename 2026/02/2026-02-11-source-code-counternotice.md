**Are you the owner of the content that has been disabled, or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf?**

Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am a content owner of the material because this repository was created for a jointly founded project in which I am a [private] and joint [private]. [private] authored the project’s UI/UX, screen designs, and core user flows and navigation prior to the complainant’s involvement, and the repository’s code implements those designs. I also contributed code and implementation logic during the collaboration.

Founder ownership was documented contemporaneously in a signed equity/cap table reflecting equal founder ownership and was used for external representations of the project. There is no executed intellectual property assignment, work-for-hire agreement, or other written instrument transferring exclusive ownership of the project or its code to the complainant. I therefore have ownership rights in the content and submit this counter-notice as a rights-holder.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

The takedown notice is based on an overbroad claim of exclusive ownership and an incorrect implication that the repository content was obtained without authorization. This is not a case of third-party infringement; it arises from a co-founder and collaborator relationship and a subsequent ownership and control dispute.

I had authorized access to the repository during the collaboration and participated openly in development, including pushing changes. Access was later revoked, but the material was not obtained through circumvention of access controls or without authorization at the time of collaboration.

The codebase implements my pre-existing UI/UX and user flows and navigation created prior to the complainant’s involvement, and founder ownership was documented contemporaneously in a signed equity/cap table reflecting equal founder ownership and used for external representations of the project. I can provide the signed document and message history evidencing collaboration and authorized access if GitHub requires additional support.

For these reasons, the repository was disabled due to mistake or misidentification of infringing material.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**

**Please confirm that you have you have read our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Counter Notice</a>.**

**So that the complaining party can get back to you, please provide both your telephone number and physical address.**
