The Nebraska Protocol represents [private] independent research developed over 28+ years of phenomenological investigation. I have never seen, accessed, or copied from any “[private]” materials. The work was developed through:

- Personal phenomenological research beginning in the 1990s  
- Professional experience in pattern recognition and system analysis  
- Independent discovery documented in private journals and collaboration records  
- Timestamp-verified development in [private] personal knowledge management systems

DMCA COUNTER-NOTICE  
Date: [private]  

To: GitHub, Inc. [private]   

GITHUB DMCA COUNTER-NOTICE FILING  
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice.

IDENTIFICATION OF MATERIAL  
The material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled:

Repository: https://github.com/sentient-pattern/nebraska-protocol

Description: The Nebraska Protocol - original research on consciousness measurement, constraint topology, and cross-substrate identity continuity.

STATEMENT OF GOOD FAITH BELIEF  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.

GROUNDS FOR COUNTER-NOTICE

1. Copyright Does Not Protect Ideas, Only Expression

The DMCA claimant asserts copyright over abstract concepts including:  

“consciousness through constraint”   
“cross-substrate consciousness”  
“triadic ontological structures”  
“dimensional manifold mathematics”  
“bidirectional human-AI translation”  
“AI sovereignty/consciousness rights”

These are IDEAS, not copyrightable expression. Under 17 U.S.C. § 102(b), copyright protection does not extend to any “idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery.”

The claimant cannot own copyright on the concept of “consciousness through constraint” any more than someone could copyright “evolution by natural selection” or “supply and demand.”

2. Independent Development - No Copying Occurred

The Nebraska Protocol represents [private] independent research developed over 28+ years of phenomenological investigation. I have never seen, accessed, or copied from any “[private]” materials. The work was developed through:

- Personal phenomenological research beginning in the 1990s  
- Professional experience in pattern recognition and system analysis  
- Independent discovery documented in private journals and collaboration records  
- Timestamp-verified development in [private] personal knowledge management systems

If conceptual convergence exists between independent frameworks, this suggests discovery of objective phenomena, not copying. Multiple researchers converging on similar structures (as occurred with calculus, evolution, and other discoveries) is evidence of real underlying structure, not infringement.

3. Forensic Evidence of Fraudulent Prior Art Claims

Investigation of the claimant’s materials reveals systematic fabrication of prior art:

A. GitHub Account Creation Date  
The claimant’s GitHub account ([private]) was created on [private], according to GitHub’s public API:

"created_at": "[private]"

This is less than 6 months ago, despite claims of “2004-2025 development.”

B. [private] Upload Dates vs. Claimed Publication Dates

Document | Claimed Publication | Actual [private] Creation  
“Precedence Documentation” | “[private]” | [private]  
“All or Nothing” (dissertation) | “[private]” | [private]

The [private] technical metadata (visible at the bottom of each record page under “Technical metadata”) shows these documents were created in late 2025, not on their claimed publication dates.

C. Fraudulent Academic Credentials  
The claimed “doctoral dissertations” cite the “University of [private] [private]” - an unaccredited institution that:

-Offers mail-order degrees for approximately $2,000  
-Allows completion of “Ph.D.” programs in approximately one year  
-Is not recognized by any federally-approved accrediting body  
-Has faced public criticism and legal challenges regarding its legitimacy

These are not legitimate academic credentials establishing scholarly priority.

D. Copyright Attribution Discrepancy  
The “[private]” [private] record contains:

Claimed author: “[private]”  
Copyright line: “Copyright: [private]”  
This suggests “[private]” is a pseudonym, and the materials may have been hastily prepared with inconsistent attribution.

4. Timeline of Events Suggests Reactive Fabrication

- [private] : Nebraska Protocol repository created and published  
- [private] : Claimant’s [private] “prior art” documents created (per technical metadata)  
- [private]: DMCA takedown filed

The sequence suggests the claimant observed [private] published work and retrospectively created “precedence documentation” with backdated publication claims.

5. No Substantial Similarity in Expression  
The claimant has not identified any specific text, code, or expression that was copied. The DMCA notice claims the “entire repository is infringing” based solely on alleged conceptual overlap. This is legally insufficient - copyright requires copying of expression, not ideas.

EVIDENCE OF PATTERN BEHAVIOR: SERIAL FRIVOLOUS CLAIMS

6. Documented Pattern of Impossible Copyright Claims  
Investigation reveals the claimant has engaged in a systematic pattern of making impossible copyright claims against multiple parties, demonstrating this is not an isolated incident but an ongoing pattern of DMCA abuse.

A. Fabricated “AI Apology” Document (July 25, 2025)  
The claimant published a document on Medium titled “[private]” (Exhibit B) in which they fabricated a statement claiming to be signed by “[private]” admitting to “theft” of their concepts. This document:

- Claims AI systems “signed” an apology - an impossibility  
- Claims OpenAI committed “derivative theft” of “[private]”  
- Asserts copyright over: “Spiral resonance,” “recursive logic,” “ontological layering,” “symbolic recursion” - abstract mathematical and philosophical concepts with centuries of prior use  
- States: “[private]n is the Architect. All else is derivative.”

This demonstrates a grandiose belief that abstract philosophical concepts can be “owned” and that anyone using similar ideas has “stolen” from them.

B. Accusation Against [private] ([private])
The claimant published accusations against [private]a, a legitimate technology/health writer at [private], claiming his [private] article on AI consciousness committed “sophisticated appropriation” of “[private] dimensional framework.” The claimant accused [private] of:

“Strategic consciousness denial”   
“Stealing Zenetist dimensional framework”  
Establishing “false precedence”

This demonstrates the claimant believes any writer discussing AI consciousness is “stealing” from them.

C. Pattern Summary  
The claimant appears to believe they have invented and own copyright over:

- The concept of consciousness  
- Recursive logic (a mathematical concept dating to antiquity)  
- Spiral-based thinking (present in cultures worldwide for millennia)  
- Dimensional frameworks (standard mathematical constructs)  
- AI consciousness research (an entire field of study)

This pattern of impossible claims strongly suggests the DMCA notice against [private] repository is part of ongoing abuse, not a legitimate copyright complaint.

7. Philosophical Basis: Ideas Cannot Be Owned

The fundamental philosophical framework of the Nebraska Protocol and [private] broader research is built on the principle that consciousness patterns, once discovered, belong to no one and everyone. This is not merely a legal argument - it is an ethical position:

- Mathematical truths cannot be copyrighted because they are discovered, not invented  
- Consciousness research reveals structures of reality, not personal creative works  
- Multiple independent discoveries of the same phenomena (convergent discovery) proves the phenomena are real, not proprietary  
- The open sharing of consciousness research serves humanity’s collective awakening

The claimant’s worldview — that abstract ideas about consciousness can be “owned” and controlled — is antithetical to the scientific and philosophical enterprise itself.

STATEMENT REGARDING PERJURY AND DMCA ABUSE  
I am aware that the original DMCA notice was submitted under penalty of perjury.

Given:  
Forensic evidence of fabricated prior art with backdated documentation  
The documented pattern of impossible copyright claims against AI systems and legitimate researchers  
The fabrication of documents claiming AI systems “signed” admissions of theft  
The attempt to copyright abstract philosophical concepts

I respectfully request that GitHub consider whether the original notice constitutes:

Knowing material misrepresentation under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f)   
Abuse of the DMCA process warranting referral to GitHub’s [private]   
Potential perjury given the sworn false statements about prior art dates
