**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The MIT License grants permission to use the software only on the condition that the original copyright notice and permission notice are included in all copies. The user has willfully removed [private] copyright notice from the LICENSE file and replaced it with their own. By failing to include the mandatory attribution, the user has violated the conditions of the license and therefore has no right to distribute the software.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

As the license conditions have been violated, the user has no right to distribute this software. The repository must be disabled until the user creates a new, compliant version that restores the original MIT License and attribution.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
