I am writing to file a counter-notice pursuant to sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material.

1. Identification of the material that has been removed: The repository at: https://github.com/Zhangzy-54/Procyon

2. Statement of Dispute: I believe this takedown notice is based on a misidentification of the software’s origin and copyright status. The repository "Procyon" is a derivative work based on a project lineage originally known as "Prax" and subsequently "Solstice."

Contrary to the complainant's claim that the work is a "private, non-open-source" project, the source code for Prax and Solstice has been publicly distributed and made available for download within the developer community via platforms such as [private]. Because the foundational code was already publicly accessible and shared prior to the creation of this repository, the complainant's assertion of exclusive, private ownership over the entire codebase is incorrect. [private] repository consists of modifications to this publicly distributed base, not an unauthorized leak of private, proprietary material.

3. My Contact Information:

Full Legal Name: [private]

Email Address: [private]

Phone Number: [private]

Physical Address: [private]

4. Required Legal Statements:

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.

I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.
