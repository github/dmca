**Are you the owner of the content that has been disabled, or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf?**

Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

The GitHub account and GitHub Pages website mentioned in this counter notice are owned and operated by [private]. I am submitting this counter notice on [private] [private] behalf with reference to content that [private] produced and [private] in charge of, and that does not host or contain any copyrighted property that belongs to the claimant.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The GitHub Pages website linked to [private] account, https://wonderlandcentral.github.io, was taken down. The repository of this website does not host or distribute any copyrighted software or files; it only includes a few static HTML files for redirection to the mentioned wonderland.ac domain.

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

The DMCA takedown seems to mix up content hosted on GitHub with external websites and downloads. The allegedly infringing software mentioned in the notice is not hosted, stored, or distributed by [private] GitHub Pages repository. There are no proprietary materials, source code, or copyrighted binaries on the GitHub Pages website that belong to the claimant. Because of this, the takedown of content housed on GitHub is predicated on an incorrect identification of the location and type of allegedly infringing content.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**

**Please confirm that you have you have read our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Counter Notice</a>.**
