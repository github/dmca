NOTIFICATION OF BREACH OF SITE'S PUBLISHED TERMS OF SERVICE

*** COPYRIGHT ADVISORY – The copyrights in the audio and / or audio-visual master recording(s) and, as applicable, the musical composition(s) (including lyrics) embodied thereon are exclusively owned by the Rights Owners (as set-out below) for the remaining period of copyright in all applicable countries of the world (including, but not limited to, the United States of America). Any unauthorized use or exploitation of the relevant copyrights constitutes a clear infringement of such copyrights and the corresponding performers’ rights, moral rights, rights-of-publicity, goodwill, trademarks and all other pertinent rights of an intellectual property nature. Such activities also blatantly infringe and contravene – inter alia – United States, British, European Union and international copyright laws. ***

*** CONSUMER PROTECTION ADVISORY – For the avoidance of doubt, the Infringing / Violating Materials on the Infringing / Violating Web-Site (as specified / defined below) are NOT authorized, or otherwise endorsed by or affiliated with, the Rights Owners. The Infringing / Violating Activity complained of and specified below not only infringes the intellectual property of the Rights Owners, but also violates California state, United States federal, British, European Union and international consumer protection laws and treaties (by misleading consumers and members of the public into thinking or assuming that the web-site in question – and, moreover, all products and services advertised thereon – is connected with or otherwise approved by the Rights Owners and which, again, is NOT the case). ***

*** CACHE ADVISORY – This DMCA request and consumer protection notification relates to both A. the Infringing / Violating Materials as again defined and notified below and, equally, B. the source files and so-called 'robots.txt' files containing and otherwise relating to the Infringing / Violating Materials on the Infringing / Violating Web-Site's servers (as applicable and once again as defined below). Accordingly, please ensure the removal of all relevant server-stored content and robots.txt files at the same time as the Infringing / Violating Materials are taken-down and in order to also ensure that any such server-stored content and files are not indexed / re-indexed and published by internet search engines (and, equally, so that such search engines' listings and caches can be properly cleared of the pertinent Infringing / Violating Materials). Thank you. ***
