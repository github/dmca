**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
I am the [private] and copyright holder of the Atoll open-source project. [private] created the original source code files at issue and have the exclusive copyright to those original contributions. The Atoll project is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**  
  
The original copyrighted works include multiple Swift source files from the Atoll project implementing non-trivial macOS functionality, including but not limited to:  
  
• A SwiftUI 3D parallax hover effect using continuous hover tracking, geometry measurement, normalized mouse position mapping, animated 3D rotations, and scaling behavior.  
• System-level managers implementing media key interception, lock screen window management, hardware monitoring (volume, brightness, battery), and drag-and-drop handling.  
  
These works reflect original expression in their structure, sequence, logic, and implementation details, not merely abstract ideas or standard APIs.  
  
**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**  
  
**Based on the above, I confirm that:**  
  
Specific files within the repository are infringing  
  
**Identify only the specific file URLs within the repository that is infringing:**

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**  
  
**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**  
  
Yes  
  
**Which license?**  
  
gnu-general-public-license-v3.0  
  
**How do you believe the license is being violated?**  
  
The identified files are derivative works of GPL-licensed source files from the Atoll project.  
  
A technical comparison reveals extensive parity in structure, control flow, mathematical logic, API usage, constants, and helper functions, including identical implementations for:  
  
• Continuous hover-based 3D parallax rotation logic  
• Temporary file lifecycle management  
• Media key interception using Carbon events  
• Lock screen window ordering via SkyLight  
• Hardware monitoring using CoreAudio, IOKit, and DisplayServices  
  
These similarities go beyond shared ideas or use of public APIs and constitute copied expression. The derivative files do not preserve required copyright notices, author attribution, or GPL v3 license headers, and instead present the works as original.  
  
As such, the distribution of these files violates GPL v3  
  
**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**  
  
Compliance may be achieved by either:  
  
Adding appropriate copyright notices, attribution, and GPL v3 license headers to each derivative source file, clearly identifying the Atoll project as the upstream source; or  
  
Removing the identified derivative source files from the repository.  
  
External acknowledgments (e.g., on a website) are not sufficient to meet GPL requirements, as attribution must be preserved within the distributed source files themselves.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**  
  
**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**  
  
**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
