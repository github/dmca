Dear GitHub Legal Team，

 

I am [private], a member of the [private] department of UNISOC Technologies Co.,Ltd (“UNISOC”).

I have read and understood GitHub's "DMCA Notice Submission Guidelines"

I represent UNISOC Technologies Co.,Ltd (“UNISOC”), the exclusive rights holder of certain proprietary source code.

 

It has come to our attention that files from the following folders in the specific GitHub repositories have been released without authorization, containing UNISOC's proprietary source code:

 

Folder URL：https://github.com/sieyron/android_vendor_sprd/tree/b7db300157d48be0f96673a94b206cbd25d5b5b0/open-source/tools/slogmodem
