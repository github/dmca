We represent The New York Times Company ("The Times"), the owner of the famous and widely known WORDLE game. I am authorized to submit this Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") takedown notice regarding copyright infringement on a [private]-hosted website on behalf of The Times. The [private]-hosted website https://roguewordle.com/ displays content that infringes on our client's intellectual property rights including copyright. 
 
By way of background, on January 24, 2022, The Times purchased the popular word game "Wordle" (and all associated intellectual property rights with the game) from the game's [private] [private], including but not limited to the common-law trademark rights to the "Wordle" trademark, the copyright in the game, and the trade dress associated with the game. The Times's acquisition of the game was widely reported in widely available news sources. 
 
The official Wordle game can be found here: https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html. The Times owns U.S. Copyright Reg. No. [private] for the Wordle game, with a June 20, 2021 date of publication. 
 
The following [private]-hosted website contains The Times' copyrighted content: https://roguewordle.com/. 
 
In particular, the website contains a knock off version of the same copyrighted Wordle puzzle owned by The Times. The layout, color scheme, and gameplay are identical to The Times's "Wordle" game. See https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html. 
 
The infringing website also uses The Times's "Wordle" trademark without authorization. Clearly, this is a blatant attempt to trade off The Times's well-known "Wordle" brand and confuse consumers into believing they are playing a legitimate version of the Wordle game, when they are not. This unauthorized use of The Times's game constitutes copyright infringement. As the infringing website's host and now having knowledge of the infringement, you may be found liable for contributory infringement.
 
We therefore demand the infringing website be removed immediately. We have a good faith belief that this usage has not been authorized by us, by our agent, or by law. On behalf of The Times, we hereby request that you immediately disable and take down the infringing material. 

I have taken fair use into consideration.
 
THIS IS A DMCA TAKE DOWN NOTICE.   
Under penalty of perjury, I hereby declare that this Notice is accurate and that I am authorized to act on behalf of The Times. 
 
I look forward to your prompt response, as required by law. 
 
Regards,
