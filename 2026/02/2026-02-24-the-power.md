**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

Specific files within the repository are infringing

**Identify only the specific file URLs within the repository that is infringing:**

1. https://github.com/AhmadMotasemAlHanbali/ScanMasterEye/blob/main/ScanMasterEye.py  
- This file contains the main scanning engine which copies the port selection logic (21,22,23,80,443) and security confirmation philosophy from my original work.

2. https://github.com/AhmadMotasemAlHanbali/ScanMasterEye/blob/main/ScanMaserEyeCLI(for%20linux).py  
- This file replicates the command-line interaction style and security confirmation approach from my original THE_POWER.py.

3. https://github.com/AhmadMotasemAlHanbali/ScanMasterEye/blob/main/README.md  
- The description misrepresents the origin of the tool's core concepts.
