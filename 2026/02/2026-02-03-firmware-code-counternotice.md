The takedown notice appears to be from a person or associate of their who is mad at [private] and misusing this process in a malicious take-down attack.

The complainant has not identified any specific copyrighted source code, nor provided proof of ownership over any code contained in this repository.

The ProtoPirate project is the result of independent, original development, with a public commit history demonstrating progressive creation over time. The repository does not contain proprietary firmware, leaked source code, stolen binaries, or anything belonging to the complainant. We have many contributors all making many commits, PRs, etc. further showing constant work and independent code. You can see the mistakes, fixes, code commenting, and everything else needed as proof.

The claim that the entire repository is infringing is vague, unsupported, and inconsistent with the actual content. This is a dispute motivated by competition and personal conflict rather than a legitimate copyright claim.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**
