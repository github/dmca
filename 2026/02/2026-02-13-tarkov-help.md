**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I [private] created and/or commissioned the creation of the content published on this website and hold the exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute, display, and make it available to the public.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The copyrighted work consists of original interactive digital map content and related materials published on https://tarkov.help/en

The website provides certain content for free; however, access to specific premium map pages and their full functionality is restricted to users who have purchased paid access. These premium pages include, but are not limited to:

https://tarkov.help/en/map/streets  
https://tarkov.help/en/map/shoreline  
https://tarkov.help/en/map/labs  
https://tarkov.help/en/map/interchange  
https://tarkov.help/en/map/reserve  
https://tarkov.help/en/map/lighthouse

These pages contain original copyrighted materials, including interactive maps, graphical assets, layouts, data layers, text descriptions, and other proprietary content. Access to this content is restricted through a paywall mechanism and is available only to users who have lawfully purchased premium access.

The browser extension hosted in the referenced GitHub repository is specifically designed to remove or disable the paywall element on these pages, thereby allowing users to access the premium copyrighted content without authorization or payment.

By intentionally bypassing the technical protection measures implemented on the website, the extension facilitates unauthorized access to copyrighted works and infringes upon my exclusive rights.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

The original copyrighted website is available at: https://tarkov.help

Examples of premium content pages:  
https://tarkov.help/en/map/streets  
https://tarkov.help/en/map/shoreline  
https://tarkov.help/en/map/labs  
https://tarkov.help/en/map/interchange  
https://tarkov.help/en/map/reserve  
https://tarkov.help/en/map/lighthouse

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/GlassySundew/tarkov-help-unlocker

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The website https://tarkov.help/en implements a paywall system to control access to premium copyrighted content.

Access to premium map pages is restricted to authenticated users who have purchased paid access. The access control mechanism includes: User authentication and account-based authorization; Server-side access checks linked to active paid subscriptions; Front-end paywall overlay that prevents viewing and interaction with premium content unless the user is authorized; Controlled delivery and rendering of premium interactive map elements only for authorized users.

These technological measures effectively restrict access to the copyrighted interactive maps, graphical assets, data layers, and related proprietary materials to paying subscribers only.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused browser extension is specifically designed to remove or disable the paywall element implemented on the premium map pages of https://tarkov.help/en

By programmatically altering the page’s structure and removing the paywall overlay, the extension allows users to access and interact with premium copyrighted content without authentication and without purchasing paid access.

This functionality intentionally circumvents the technological protection measures that control access to the copyrighted material and enables unauthorized access to premium content.
