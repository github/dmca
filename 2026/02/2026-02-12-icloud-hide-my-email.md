**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and copyright owner of the “iCloud Hide My Email” browser extension source code and related project materials. [private] created and published the project in 2022 and have maintained it since then. I am submitting this notice on [private] own behalf as the copyright owner.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The copyrighted work is [private] open-source software project implementing a browser extension that integrates with Apple iCloud “Hide My Email” functionality. The protected work includes the extension’s source code, the project’s structure/organization, and associated documentation and assets as published in [private] repository.

The repository I am reporting appears to reproduce substantial portions of [private] codebase and project structure, with only minor changes (primarily UI/styling). It is not presented as a fork of [private] repository, and it does not include upstream attribution or preserve the required MIT copyright and permission notice for the copied portions. As a result, it presents copied/derived work as an independent original project.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

https://github.com/dedoussis/icloud-hide-my-email-browser-extension

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/dlev02/HideMyEmail-Chrome-Extension

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

mit-license

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The original project is licensed under the MIT License. MIT permits reuse and redistribution but requires that the copyright notice and the MIT permission notice be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software. The reported repository reproduces substantial portions of [private] MIT-licensed source code, but it does not include [private] copyright notice or the MIT license text anywhere in the repository/distribution and provides no upstream attribution. Distributing substantial portions of MIT-licensed code without preserving the required notices violates the MIT license terms.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

Remove all copied code from [private] MIT-licensed project, or add upstream attribution + include [private] MIT copyright and permission notice (e.g., LICENSE-MIT/NOTICE) and clearly identify the repo as a derivative/fork (not an independent original implementation). Making the repo private only stops public distribution on GitHub and doesn’t address other distribution.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
