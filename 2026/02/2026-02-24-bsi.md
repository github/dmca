**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am submitting this notice on behalf of PT Bank Syariah Indonesia Tbk ("BSI"). I am authorized to act for BSI through CTM360's [private], which is engaged by BSI for incident response and security investigations. BSI is the owner (or exclusive licensee) of the proprietary software code, configurations, scripts, and related implementation artifacts referenced in this notice. CTM360 CIRT is authorized by BSI to submit takedown requests and coordinate remediation for unauthorized publication of BSI-owned or BSI-commissioned copyrighted materials.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The copyrighted work consists of BSI's proprietary Identity Governance / IAM implementation artifacts, including custom scripts and business logic used in BSI's SailPoint IdentityIQ environment to generate and map employee email addresses and identity attributes. These works include (but are not limited to):

- Custom source code implementing BSI-specific identity attribute handling (e.g., use of empId, name concatenation rules, truncation rules, uniqueness checks via query filters, and domain assignments specific to BSI/legacy entities).

- Source code and related configuration logic that references and operates on BSI identity objects and data structures (e.g., sailpoint.object.Identity, QueryOptions, Filter, and identity attribute mappings).

- Proprietary implementation details for BSI email-generation logic and identity mapping rules, including handling of BSI domains (e.g., [private]) and legacy domain patterns (e.g., [private]), uniqueness checks, and suffixing logic derived from employee identifiers.

The GitHub repository reproduces all or substantial portions of these proprietary code snippets and implementation logic without authorization. The presence of BSI-specific domains, identity attribute naming, and implementation patterns indicates it is not generic sample code, but BSI’s proprietary implementation artifacts.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

The original copyrighted work is not intended for public distribution and is maintained in BSI's internal systems and/or authorized vendor-controlled repositories/environments. Therefore, there is no public URL for the original work.
