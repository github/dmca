PRIVILEGED & CONFIDENTIAL SETTLEMENT COMMUNICATION ([private])  
VIA E-MAIL

Copyright Counsel for GITHUB  

Re: Demand for Immediate Removal of Images To Cease Copyright Infringement –  
Takedown Request ID [private]  

Dear Counsel,

This firm represents Bella + Canvas, LLC (“Bella Canvas”) and Color Image Apparel,
Inc. (“Color Image Apparel” or “CIA”; together, “our clients”). We write to formally demand
that you immediately remove unauthorized images of [private] currently used on your
website that infringe copyrights owned by our clients (hereinafter, the “Infringing Images”).

The Infringing Images were taken from Bella Canvas’s original photography published on
its website years ago (hereinafter, the “Copyrighted Images”). CIA is the exclusive owner by
assignment of all right, title, and interest to the Copyrighted Images, as reflected in Exhibit B (true
and correct copy of the relevant copyright registration) and Exhibit C (true and correct copy of
assignment of copyright from the photographer(s) to CIA evidencing CIA’s ownership of the
Copyrighted Images). While CIA has not applied for registrations from the Copyright Office for
each of the hundreds or thousands of images in any given photoshoot, they are original works of
authorship protected by copyright (17 U.S.C. § 102(a)) now owned by CIA per this assignment.

These Infringing Images shown on your website are identical to the Copyrighted Images,
or else are derivative works that were created without permission and remain substantially similar
to the Copyrighted Images. In either event, each of the Infringing Images violates Color Image
Apparel’s exclusive interests in its copyrights. See, e.g., 17 U.S.C. § 106(1) and (2). The
Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. §§ 101 et seq., provides significant legal and equitable remedies against
anyone who infringes any of the exclusive rights of a copyright owner. If our clients are forced to
seek relief in court, CIA will be entitled, as applicable, to seek statutory damages under 17 U.S.C.
§504 as well as attorney’s fees and costs of enforcement pursuant to 17 U.S.C. §505. 

We trust that no legal action will be necessary and you will instead comply with this request
to take down all Infringing Images identified, destroy all copies to avoid re-posting in the future,
and confirm your compliance in writing to [private] (with the Subject Line:
“Compliance with Takedown Request ID [private]") within seven (7)
days.

For ease of reference, an archived webpage showing photos of [private] and other
models—which are representative of our clients’ Copyrighted Images—can be found at:
[private].
Attached hereto as Exhibit A is a true and correct copy of screenshots of your website where the
Infringing Images are displayed and the associated information to assist in your review. Further,
the URL addresses for the Copyrighted Images and/or pages displaying those images that we have
been able to locate on your website are listed here to aid in achieving prompt compliance:

We demand that you confirm in writing within seven (7) days of the date of this letter
that (1) the Copyrighted Images have been removed from your website and (2) all copies of the
Copyrighted Images have been destroyed to ensure that these images will not be used in the future.
Please direct this response to the email address provided ([private]) and include the
Subject Line: “Compliance with Takedown Request ID [private] to ensure
that it is processed quickly. 

Please also note, pursuant to the notice requirements of the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act (“DMCA”), 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3)(A), our firm (i) is authorized to act on behalf of our clients
and specifically CIA (i.e. the owner of the exclusive rights allegedly infringed); (ii) we have
provided a representative list of the Copyrighted Images claimed to have been infringed via the
Web Archive site provided above; (iii) we have also identified the Infringing Images with
sufficient information to locate that material; (iv) our contact information is provided herewith;
(v) we have a good faith belief use of this material in the manner complained of is not authorized
by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (vi) the information contained in this notification
is accurate, and—under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States—we are authorized
to act on behalf of CIA as the owner of the exclusive rights allegedly infringed as stated herein. 

In addition to our clients’ copyright interest in removing these images, as outlined above,
we also note that the model depicted in these photographs ([private]) has not provided his
permission for your use of these photographs. Your commercial use of these photographs without
his permission is therefore subject to his further claims for violation of his rights of publicity under e.g. California Civil Code Section 3344(a) (“(a) Any person who knowingly uses another’s . . .
photograph, or likeness, in any manner, on or in products, merchandise, or goods, or for purposes
of advertising or selling, or soliciting purchases of, products, merchandise, goods or
services, without such person’s prior consent, . . . shall be liable for any damages sustained by the
person or persons injured as a result thereof….”); see also id. (also providing for liability in an
amount of $750 or actual damages [whichever is greater], punitive damages, and attorney’s fees).
Therefore, please be advised—even if you dispute our clients’ copyright claims outlined herein—
you should still permanently remove the at-issue images to avoid significant liability for violating
the rights of the person whose photograph you are using without permission, i.e. [private]. 

Your immediate attention to this matter and prompt response in line with this reasonable
takedown request are appreciated. The above statements do not constitute a complete or
exhaustive statement of our clients’ rights and remedies, none of which is intended to be waived
or prejudiced hereby, and all of which rights and remedies are hereby expressly reserved. 

Very truly yours,

RUTAN & TUCKER, LLP
