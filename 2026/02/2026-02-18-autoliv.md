**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am an [private] [private] [private] at Autoliv which is an automative safety company headquartered in [private]. It was brought to my notice that some of the proprietary development work we have been working with our Customer has been posted on GitHub without authorization. We are seeking urgent help to restrict the public visibility of this github repo at the earliest. We do not know who has posted the content but our internal investigation is underway.

The offending account is https://github.com/workwithoutread

There are 3 public repositories listed:  
https://github.com/workwithoutread/mercedes_daimler_project  
https://github.com/workwithoutread/volkswagen_audi_project  
https://github.com/workwithoutread/geely_project

ADDITIONAL INFO: We had also opened a total of 8 tickets in the last few weeks ago related to the SAME content posted (Ticket # are: 4053618, 4045880, 4035394, 4012957,3941019, 3856727, 3856933, 3859118). The outcome in those cases was the DMCA takedown of 22 repositories (original + forks). It seems this user (renamed a few times) has posted the SAME content the NINTH time.

This is not an infringing of a public fork. It is our internal development code that is proprietary that is posted unauthorized

Please note that Autoliv is also a [private] [private] customer.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

This is internal development from Autoliv. We do not have it posted publicly.

Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The code is saved into an internal repository in a product called PTC Integrity. We have access restricted to the developers who are involved. But we cannot prevent them from downloading if they need to work on it.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

At the moment the investigation as to how this was leaked and posted is underway

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>.

https://github.com/workwithoutread/volkswagen_audi_project  
https://github.com/workwithoutread/geely_project

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Repository can be made private
