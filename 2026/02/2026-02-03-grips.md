**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
I am the [private] and copyright owner.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**  
  
I am the [private] and copyright owner of GRIPS (GRidfinity Interlocking basePlate System), an original OpenSCAD-based procedural generator that produces 3D printable baseplate models for the Gridfinity storage system. The copyrighted work includes the OpenSCAD source code implementing original procedural geometry algorithms and associated original curve/geometry data arrays created by [private].  
  
The work is published on MakerWorld under [private] account (MakerWorld user “[private]”), model page: https://makerworld.com/en/models/704997  
. The model page remains publicly available; however, MakerWorld no longer displays the source-code download publicly. I retain the original source and can provide it to GitHub upon request to verify authorship and substantial similarity.  
  
In commit 1f7d117, GridPlates.scad contains an unauthorized copy and derivative of [private] proprietary GRIPS OpenSCAD source code and original data (including replicated curve/geometry data arrays and the same procedural structure), with only cosmetic changes such as renamed identifiers and minor reformatting/obfuscation. I did not authorize copying, modification, or redistribution of this code, and no license grants permission for this use.  
  
**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**
