This unauthorized distribution constitutes:  
(a) Copyright Infringement (17 U.S.C. § 106): The infringer is reproducing and distributing our
copyrighted software binary without authorization, violating our exclusive rights to reproduce,
distribute, and prepare derivative works.

have taken fair use into consideration.

6. DEMANDED ACTION  
Pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c) and GitHub's DMCA Policy, we demand the immediate and
permanent removal of the entire repository identified above. The infringing DLL is the core
functional component; the repository has no legitimate purpose without it. Failure to comply
expeditiously will result in GitHub losing its safe harbor protections under the DMCA, and we
reserve all rights to pursue legal action.
