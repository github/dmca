I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

[private] the owner of a copyrighted codebase called "GoodTube". This repository has taken a large amount of code and functionality it.

Repository:  
https://github.com/goodtube4u/goodtube

Main file where code has been copied from:  
https://github.com/goodtube4u/goodtube/blob/main/goodtube.js

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

[private] the owner of a copyrighted codebase, which this repository has unfortunately stolen a large amount of code and functionality from:  
https://github.com/goodtube4u/goodtube

It contains a copyright notice which clearly states:  
"The source code of this repository is available for personal use only. If you would like to copy and modify it for your own personal use, you're welcome to do so without any limitations.

However, the source code within this repository cannot be copied and then repackaged or rebranded as your own. Publishing any version of this code without express permission, even with minor modifications, is strictly forbidden.

------------------------------------------

The owner of this repository has stolen and distributed/published copies of [private] work multiple times over the past year or so.

Previously it was a repository here (which has now been taken down):  
[private]

Recently a new version has been published here:  
https://github.com/IframeTube/IframeTube

------------------------------------------

The main code for [private] project can be found here:  
https://github.com/goodtube4u/goodtube/blob/main/goodtube.js

You will find very similar code in this user's repository, specifically in these three files:  
https://github.com/IframeTube/IframeTube/blob/main/src/embed/embed.js  
https://github.com/IframeTube/IframeTube/blob/main/src/embed/proxy.js  
https://github.com/IframeTube/IframeTube/blob/main/src/embed/youtube.js

It has been refactored slightly, but hardly enough to avoid copyright. The functionality is the same, many of the functions are exactly the same, and even most of his wording is the same for the readme / repository.

------------------------------------------

Many of the functions are the same, though they've had the "goodTube" prefix replaced with "IframeTube".

Here is an example -

This user's copied code:

[private] original code:

Please refer to the links and I think you will find it clear that this violates [private] intellectual property and copyright.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

[private] original repository is here:  
https://github.com/goodtube4u/goodtube

And most of the code has been copied from here:  
https://github.com/goodtube4u/goodtube/blob/main/goodtube.js

You will find very similar code in this user's repository, specifically in these three files:  
https://github.com/IframeTube/IframeTube/blob/main/src/embed/embed.js  
https://github.com/IframeTube/IframeTube/blob/main/src/embed/proxy.js  
https://github.com/IframeTube/IframeTube/blob/main/src/embed/youtube.js

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

Specific files within the repository are infringing

**Identify only the specific file URLs within the repository that is infringing:**

https://github.com/IframeTube/IframeTube/blob/main/src/embed/embed.js  
https://github.com/IframeTube/IframeTube/blob/main/src/embed/proxy.js  
https://github.com/IframeTube/IframeTube/blob/main/src/embed/youtube.js

Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**
