Dear GitHub DMCA Agent,  
  
I, [private], am the owner of the copyrighted works being infringed and submit this notice in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.  
I request the removal of infringing content hosted on GitHub by the account operating under the name “Rainbow Library” (or related repositories). This user is distributing graphics, logos, and visual materials that I personally created and hold the full copyright to.  
  
The repository in question is:  
https://github.com/Rainbow-Library/rainbow-library.github.io/tree/main  
  
The repository contains extensive copyrighted material without authorization, including numerous images stored in the /vrc/images directory of the Rainbow Library GitHub project.  
This also includes the logo of the account itself.  
  
Given that the account was unlawfully taken from me under hostile circumstances,  
I am evaluating additional legal measures against the responsible parties.  
  
General Note:  
This is the second time this group delibiately infringes copyright on the github platform. Please refer to ticket: 3919092 for more context.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**  
  
- Rainbow Library primary logo - a circular emblem featuring the letters “RL,” used without authorization despite prior notice.
