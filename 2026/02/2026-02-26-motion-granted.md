**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am an [private] of Motion Granted, a proprietary legal technology SaaS platform. The software was developed privately as a commercial product and has never been released under any open source license. [private] hold direct copyright ownership in the source code, architecture, and all associated intellectual property. The infringing repository contains a complete or substantially complete copy of our proprietary codebase, including trade secrets, proprietary algorithms, and confidential business logic.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The copyrighted work is the complete source code for Motion Granted, a commercial legal technology platform that automates court-ready litigation document preparation for attorneys. The codebase includes: proprietary 14-phase AI-assisted workflow orchestration engine; proprietary 7-step citation verification pipeline; proprietary multi-model AI integration logic; proprietary document generation templates and legal formatting systems; proprietary payment processing and order management systems; and proprietary quality control protocols. The software is written in TypeScript/Next.js and has been under continuous private development. It has never been published, released, or licensed to the public. The entire codebase constitutes original, copyrightable work and contains trade secrets.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

The original work is hosted in a private [private] [private] and is not publicly available. [private]

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/justinseger015-ctrl/Motion-Granted-Production

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The source code is maintained in a private [private] repository with access restricted through [private] authentication and authorization system. Only explicitly authorized collaborators with valid [private] credentials and repository-level permissions can access the codebase. The repository has never been made public. Additionally, the production deployment uses environment-level access controls through Vercel, Supabase, and third-party API key authentication, ensuring that the application's source code and proprietary logic are not exposed to end users. These measures effectively prevent unauthorized persons from viewing, copying, or downloading the copyrighted source code.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused repository reproduces the entirety of our private, access-controlled codebase in a publicly accessible GitHub repository, thereby bypassing the access restrictions we maintain on the original private repository. The infringer either obtained unauthorized access to our private repository or received the code from someone who had authorized access and then redistributed it without permission, in violation of the access controls and confidentiality obligations in place. By publishing the code publicly, the accused project eliminates the technological access controls entirely, making our proprietary source code and trade secrets freely available to anyone on the internet.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
