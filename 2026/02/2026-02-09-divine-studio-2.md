DMCA TAKEDOWN NOTICE

1. IDENTIFICATION OF COPYRIGHTED WORKS  
Divine Studio LLC owns a proprietary code-signed build of cslol-dll.dll for our Celestial Launcher, signed
under our exclusive code signing certificate in compliance with the CSLOL DLL License Addendum.
Code Signing Certificate: [private] | [private]   | Serial: [private]  

Original Distribution: https://github.com/sxrmss/celestial-releases | https://divineskins.gg Authorization:
[private]  

2. IDENTIFICATION OF INFRINGING MATERIAL  
Infringing Repository: https://github.com/hoangvu12/bocchi  
Infringing DLL (hidden branch):  
https://github.com/hoangvu12/bocchi/raw/cslol-dll/cslol-dll.dll  
Automated Distribution Code:  
[private]  

3. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS OF INFRINGEMENT  
The repository implements an automated distribution system. Source code analysis reveals:
Line 10: Defines DLL_DOWNLOAD_URL pointing to stolen DLL hosted in cslol-dll branch
Lines 102-147: checkAndReplaceDll() function downloads our DLL and writes to users' systems
This constitutes unauthorized reproduction, automated mass distribution, and deliberate circumvention
by hosting DLL in a separate branch to obscure infringement.

4. LEGAL BASIS FOR REMOVAL  
(a) Copyright Infringement (17 U.S.C. § 106): Unauthorized reproduction and automated distribution
system.  
(b) License Violation (CSLOL DLL License Addendum v1.1): Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 5.5, and 9.1
violations.  
(c) Contributory Infringement: Software induces and facilitates infringement by end users.
(d) EU Copyright Violation: Articles 2 and 3 of EU Directive 2001/29/EC and Article 17 of EU Directive
2019/790.  
(e) Circumvention (17 U.S.C. § 1201): Extraction and automated redistribution circumvents code
signing protections.

5. GOOD FAITH STATEMENT  
I have a good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted materials described above is not authorized by
the copyright owner, its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

6. STATEMENT UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the
owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

7. DEMANDED ACTION  
Pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c), we demand immediate removal of the entire repository including all
branches (especially cslol-dll branch) and all 48 releases. The repository's core functionality depends
on our copyrighted software, and the DLL is deliberately hidden in a separate branch. Failure to comply
will result in GitHub losing safe harbor protections.
