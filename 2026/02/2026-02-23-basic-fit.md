Dear GitHub Copyright Agent,  
  
   
  
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.  
  
   
  
I am writing on behalf of Basic-Fit International B.V. to submit a formal DMCA takedown notice regarding infringing material hosted on GitHub.  
  
   
  
1. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed  
  
The copyrighted work at issue is proprietary software and related technical assets owned by Basic-Fit International B.V., including but not limited to:  
  
Proprietary systems, software logic, and workflows used to control access to Basic-Fit clubs and premium services;  
Proprietary QR code generation, validation, and access-control mechanisms implemented within Basic-Fit’s digital infrastructure;  
Related backend logic, security mechanisms, and access-control processes that are not publicly disclosed and are protected by copyright.  
This copyrighted material is proprietary, confidential, and has not been published publicly. It is used exclusively within Basic-Fit’s internal systems and official applications.  
  
   
  
   
  
2. Identification of the infringing material  
  
The allegedly infringing material is hosted at the following location:  
  
Repository URL: https://github.com/szerookii/basic-share  
  
Specific infringing material: Entire repository.  
  
The identified repository contains content that reproduces, derives from, or enables unauthorized use of the copyrighted works described above, including mechanisms intended to replicate or bypass Basic-Fit’s proprietary access-control systems.  
  
   
  
   
  
3. Forks of the repository  
  
We have reviewed the forks of the repository and believe the following forks are also infringing:  
  
https://github.com/ramie91/basic-share  
https://github.com/SiTiKctf/basic-share  
https://github.com/OloToby/basic-share  
https://github.com/VolodiaFR/basic-share  
Based on the representative number of forks reviewed, we believe that these forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.  
  
We confirm that we have investigated each identified fork and that the statements made in this notice apply to each of them.  
  
   
  
   
  
4. Steps required to remedy the infringement  
  
To remedy the infringement, the affected user would need to:  
  
Delete the repository in its entirety, as the infringing functionality is integral to the project and cannot be remedied through partial removal.  
No form of attribution or modification would be sufficient to remedy this infringement.  
  
   
  
   
  
5. Contact information of the complaining party  
  
Name: [private]  
Company: Basic-Fit International B.V.  
Title / Role: [private]  
Email address: [private]  
Telephone number: [private]  
Physical address: [private]  
  
   
  
   
  
6. Contact information of the alleged infringer (if known)  
  
GitHub username: szerookii  
  
   
  
   
  
7. Good faith statement  
  
I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.  
  
   
  
   
  
8. Accuracy and authority statement  
  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.  
  
   
  
   
  
9. Complaint regarding circumvention of technological protection measures (17 U.S.C. §1201)  
  
In addition to the copyright infringement described above, the reported repository circumvents technological measures that effectively control access to copyrighted works.  
  
Basic-Fit has implemented technical protection measures designed to control access to copyrighted software systems and services, including secure QR code generation, validation mechanisms, backend authorization checks, and access-control systems that restrict entry to physical locations and premium services.  
  
These measures ensure that only authorized users with valid subscriptions or permissions may access Basic-Fit clubs and premium services. Access is controlled through proprietary systems that validate credentials and QR codes against secure backend infrastructure.  
  
The accused project is designed to generate or simulate QR codes and access mechanisms that bypass or undermine Basic-Fit’s technological protection measures, enabling unauthorized access to copyrighted systems and services without proper authorization.
