**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

We are [private] acting on behalf of the copyright owner, Ryke Productions Ltd.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

Ryke Productions Ltd owns and operates the account [private] on [private], through which it offers various online games that Ryke has developed on the platform, one of which is the game “Criminality”. Criminality is a free-roaming fighting game, which was created by Ryke on 1 October 2020 and its profile page on the Roblox website is visible at https://www.roblox.com/games/4588604953/Criminality.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/GlobeTBS/Criminality-Game-Leaks

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Ryke Production Ltd's game on the Roblox platform employs several technological protection measures that restrict user access to the game’s proprietary source code and internal assets. Roblox uses a client–server execution model in which core game logic and proprietary scripts operate server‑side, meaning they are not accessible to users or to the client environment under normal operation. This server‑side architecture functions as a technological access‑control measure because users cannot view, extract, or access server‑stored code without bypassing these protections. Roblox’s system prevents unauthorized access through sandboxing, non‑accessible server containers, and internal execution that does not expose the underlying code to players.

These technical measures effectively control access because the protected content cannot be accessed without applying specific technological processes or tools that defeat Roblox’s access controls. Roblox’s design ensures that users of the platform — including developers and players — cannot access server‑side code or protected scripts through ordinary means. These elements are not downloaded to the client, cannot be inspected or extracted, and are secured behind platform‑level technical restrictions.

The repository at issue contains and distributes server‑side source code and internal assets that were not available to any user through the Roblox platform. The presence of such materials indicates that the individual responsible circumvented the access‑control system by using unauthorized tools, exploits, or extraction methods to bypass Roblox’s server‑side protections and obtain files that the platform’s TPMs prevent users from accessing. This constitutes a circumvention of technological protection measures as it involves bypassing access restrictions on code that is intentionally and technologically withheld from users. The project therefore both (1) contains copyrighted material that could only have been obtained through circumvention, and (2) reflects a violation of the TPMs our client employed to control access to their copyrighted work.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

In July 2023, Ryke Productions Ltd was informed by the Roblox [private] team that, as a result of Roblox security vulnerability, the entire source code of Criminality may have been copied from the Roblox secure servers.

The accused GitHub project contains and distributes source code and internal assets that are normally unavailable to users through the Roblox platform, so it is clear that it has copied the Criminality source code leaked from Roblox.

Roblox actively works with Ryke Productions Ltd to take down infringing copies of Criminality. A number of infringing copies have successfully been taken down across various platforms.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**
